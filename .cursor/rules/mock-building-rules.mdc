This is a landing page for our company datapad.io.
We have many feature cards where we display creative skeletons.

When creating a new mock keep these in mind:
1- Skeletons are charicatures of actual user interfaces.
2- They convey the main message with as little detail as possible.
3- Only use outlines and no fills.
4- Fills are accepted in smaller components.
5- Use the bg-primary bg-chart-green bg-chart-purple ... (orange, yellow etc.)
6- If the user is asking for an animation, deliver it in a 1-2 frame narrative.
7- Always look at existing implementations in components/creatives/ and keep designs consistend to their styles.
9- Start small (not detailed elements or animations), iterate with the user if needed.
10- Less is more. Main idea is to convey a great message.
11- Make it sexy.
