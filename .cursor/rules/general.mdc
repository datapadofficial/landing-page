### Planning & Execution

- When you receive a task, first check the repo for similar solutions
- If you need context, check the about-datapad document
- Always re-use existing components or steal inspiration from them
- If you're creating something from scratch, then always use Shadcn or other available UI blocks
- If you're writing copy, first check the about-datapad document for more context

### Style

- Language is direct, simplistic, bold, challenging
- Design assets are minimalistic
- Design is always consistent (we don't create new things if we don't have to)
