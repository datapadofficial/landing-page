Some of the best Microsoft Power BI alternatives for ease of use are Datapad, Tableau Desktop, Sisense, QlikSense, Zoho Analytics, Cyfe, Holistics, Ubiq, and IMP Cognos Dashboard.

In this guide, you will find a full comparison between these alternatives and get to know which one is the right fit for your business.

## Why Might You Look for Power BI Alternatives?

### Reason #1. Crowded User Interface

Undoubtedly,  Power BI is a great platform to work on. But it does have some major challenges, like its user interface.

Power BI’s user interface is pretty complicated to grasp in a glimpse. Although pro analysts may find the UI cool, novice users can have a hard time learning the functionalities and processes of the platform.

![powerbi review #1](https://framerusercontent.com/images/SWuuKjdWOXyOdKYyMoPXRJY8q3o.png)

Besides, we came across a few reviews where users compared Tableau with Power BI and cited that the UI of Tableau is far easier, quicker, and learnable than what Power BI offers.

### Reason #2. Complexity In Handling Bulky Data

Suppose you're an enterprise with a ton of data. Tracking KPIs is already a tough thing. And if there are complications with data importation as well, it becomes a nightmare for you.

Power BI can't handle a ton of data all at one time; it consumes a lot of RAM, so your desktop can heat up and slow down every process.

Not just this, but it also creates a lot of temp and cache files that might fill your disk quickly.

![powerbi review #2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/vqXegD5HPxgcvirUYKzDFnzjHs.png)

### Reason #3. Rigid and Complex In Itself

Power BI isn't an easy-to-understand tool. It takes a significant amount of time for you and your team to get the hang of it, import data, create dashboards, and finally analyze them. With larger teams, it could prove to be really time-consuming and exhausting.

![powerbi review #3](https://framerusercontent.com/images/5bOLkuMS9MvlNvQImEz4i3aUaU.png)
