GoodData is a cloud-based business intelligence (BI) and analytics platform that lets you and your business create and share interactive dashboards, reports, and insights. 

It offers tools for data integration, visualization, and predictive analytics that help you make data-driven decisions and deliver embedded analytics to customers and teams.

However, GoodData often falls short when it comes to software UI, large datasets, and flexibility.

In this article, I will tell you why you should try an alternative to GoodData and discuss the best ones in the market.

## Why Look for GoodData Alternatives?

The learning curve with GoodData stays intact to when it was first launched and poses a significant disadvantage to new and existing users. People seek alternatives to GoodData for several reasons:

- Lacks of customization options

- Confusing UI design

- Expensive and inflexible

Let's dig deeper into these reasons.

### Reason 1. Confusing User Interface

Mastering GoodData for data analysis and visualization can be challenging. The app interface is not smooth, and understanding its workings requires extensive training. 

Navigating within the platform is also time-consuming and cumbersome. For example, there is no folder management for insights. Finding a previously created insight is nearly impossible, and it's easier to start over (which makes the clutter worse).

### Reason 2. Difficulty in Handling Large Datasets

Valentin, a business analyst for a medium-sized business, encountered system slowness when dealing with large datasets.

GoodData’s Data Loading Mechanism (DLM) is not user-friendly, making it quite hectic compared to the more intuitive LDM building in Tableau or PowerBI.

Besides, some basic features are missing, such as:

- Creating custom charts is very convoluted.

- Sorting needs to be globally consistent. For example, you can't sort a pivot table by its total sum.

- You can't hide fields in the data model.

- You can't use OR filters - everything has to be either an AND filter or made via custom expressions.

- You can't calculate min/max dates. For example, the MIN date of a sale or something similar.

The lack of nitty-gritty functions, coupled with the system's inability to handle large-scale data analysis, leads users to seek alternatives to GoodData. 

*"…when used with large data sets, the system slows down when generating reports. Sometimes they have limited our ability to quickly churn out and analyze reports as needed."* - [Valentin P](https://www.g2.com/products/gooddata/reviews/gooddata-review-10126181)., Business analyst.

### Reason 3. GoodData is Expensive

GoodData does not offer a free plan. For other plans, it charges a hefty $1500 platform fee plus $30 per user per month.

Imagine scaling your data processes with GoodData. The pricing feels over budget and inflexible for startups and SMBs, too. 

*"...as our data needs grew, the limitations became apparent. Scaling the platform for larger datasets got expensive quickly, and the pricing structure felt inflexible for our evolving requirements". *- [Jessica W.](https://www.g2.com/products/gooddata/reviews/gooddata-review-9310912), Senior Marketing Executive
