 	3 Reasons Why You Might Need a Klipfolio Alternative? 	11 Best Klipfolio Alternatives to Try this Year 	Keep All Your KPIs In Your Pocket?

![Klipfolio alternatives table](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TfBVdlm9j1RyqarlGNMkCD9WHUI.png)

But before comparing these Klipfolio alternatives straight off the bat, let's first discuss why you might need one in the first place.

## 3 Reasons Why You Might Need a Klipfolio Alternative?

Klipfolio is a popular tool; however, it does have some disadvantages. Let's quickly get through some of the significant disadvantages of using Klipfolio.

### Reason #1. Technical Jargon Required

Unlike other BI and KPI tracking software like Datapad and DashThis, Klipfolio has a higher learning curve. You might think, why?

Klipfolio comes with a suite of advanced features. As some of its users reported, these features are hard to understand, let alone used for non-technical members of their team.

No matter how easy-to-use Klipfolio is, you might interact with technical know-how or coding stuff at certain stages. Plus, the software in itself is a bit complicated, and users need to spend time on it to become experts.

Developers enjoy these technicalities, but non-technical guys suffer. And how many tech people have you known whose daily task is to track KPIs?

For example, we came across a few reviews where users faced trouble framing the backend of their dashboard. The technicalities were beyond their control until they hired a developer for the same.

![G2 Klipfolio negative review](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CkAWvBkmYImqWjeSHwYlXg5KM.png)

Moreover, the syntax for formulas and names of functions varies a bit from excel or google sheets. Taking you a while to equate and customize formulas.

Evidently, the technicalities involved with Klipfolio makes it a try-fail-learn software.

So, why use a trial-and-error process when you can enjoy error-free analytics with Klipfolio's alternatives?

### Reason #2. Overwhelming Limitations

Klipfolio struggles with minor and major limitations in its software. Although the software is regularly updated, the limitations are not yet considered.

Let's get through a few of its limitations that frustrate users.

Firstly, Klipfolio has API connectors, but their functionality is limited; it has no database to pipe in data from multiple sources. Meaning, you can't pull all the business data from some platforms (none of the connectors let you pull 100% data off).

![G2 Klipfolio Negative review - 2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/NwdUBHieYCEV6qcPVI2peFjOGt0.png)

Secondly, Klipfolio has certain .csv file size limitations that become challenging for users to stick through.

It also has some design limitations that make it hard to adjust complex KPIs under one unified dashboard.

And lastly, dashboards do not refresh on their own. Although this should be among the free features, with Klipfolio, you need to pay the price to enjoy automatic updates.

### Reason #3. Poor Loading Time

Suppose you paid for a software to speed up your work and are suddenly encountering poor loading time. We understand that feeling, so we're bound to share some better alternatives with you.

With Klipfolio, business dashboards and reports can sometimes take a while to load. Moreover, Some of the easier tasks take a little longer than you thought.

This slow-down might be due to complex KPIs and multiple databases. But, on the second note, why would you be looking for software to perform the complex tasks for you if it were that simple?

![G2 Klipfolio negative review - 3](https://framerusercontent.com/images/oept3reAgTqap17UQIjRXLaZPc.png)

Now that you know why you might need a Klipfolio alternative, it’s time to explore your options.
