In this guide, you will find a detailed review of these dashboard software and also find the best one to reshape your performance measurement and reporting process.

But first things first, let‚Äôs address a basic question‚Ä¶

## What Is a Dashboard?

![dashboard](https://framerusercontent.com/images/qD0JIueBRW3ZPyb2w0KLRz5xEA.png)

A dashboard is a graphical representation of all your data collected from different sources and channels to be displayed under a unified section.

While a dashboard can be used for all the good reasons, business owners typically use it as a knee-jerk reaction when they need to measure their business performance at-a-glance.

What's more, Dashboards generally comprise a set of KPIs and metrics inclined towards determining your business success over time. 

Besides, they use tons of visualization elements like graphs, charts, tables, and even widgets to present these KPIs in an easy-to-understand format. 

If you plan on manually creating a dashboard, it might be overwhelming, hectic, and time-consuming. However, modern problems require modern solutions. üòâ

Platforms such as Datapad, Geckoboard, Databox, etc., help you create stunning dashboards with dynamic visual aids and analytical capabilities.

But with so many opinions available, how do you vouch for a dashboard that's perfect for your business needs? 

Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll help you out. ‚úåüèª

## Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best Dashboard Software For Your Team

![4 factors to consider for dashboard tool](https://framerusercontent.com/images/cZdagJk1uKE5Thpk5RUGTdIoduk.png)

### #1. Is It Easy Enough for You to Set Up?

Implementation is the most difficult part when getting your dashboard up and running. A typical dashboard tool can take up to a few minutes or even days to set up, depending on the assistance provided by the software.

Ensure that the platform provides adequate resources to help with initial configuration, like online setup guides, video tutorials, 'how-to' blogs, excellent customer support service, and more. 

Another way to gauge this factor is to check the platform's online customer reviews. We highly recommend this because customers have a lot to unfold about the tools they use online. 

### #2. Would It Give You Quick Access to Your Dashboards?

Since you‚Äôre choosing a dashboard software to save time and resources, would you mind if the tool consumes the same time buffering?

Certain factors, such as multiple logins, poor navigation, and long-loading time prevent you from getting quick access to your dashboards.

Again, make use of online reviews and ratings to compare tools that offer efficient workflow vs. those that act as bottlenecks in quickly presenting the information you need.

### #3. Can You Have Access on the Go?

Some dashboards are desktop-ridden ‚Äì you can only access them while sitting against your system. Eventually, this limits you from staying updated or accessing your dashboard when you‚Äôre away or off work. 

Nevertheless, your business is running 24/7 with or without you monitoring it. And leaving it unattended until office hours might be a little problematic at times.

So, ensure that the tool offers mobile-friendly dashboard solutions. Or even better, it comes with a dedicated mobile app. Any of these can help you access your dashboard on your mobile phone in real-time, regardless of your place or time.

### #4. Is It Easy Enough for Your Whole Team to Use It?

While a dashboard tool does automate half your work, still, a significant portion of the work is to be done by you and your team.

Works like creating KPIs, assigning roles, determining goals, comparing results, and choosing data sets, are something AI can't do on its own.

Hence, a simple yet compelling UI/UX design goes a long way to assist your team in collaborating when working on a dashboard.

Besides, if you‚Äôre a non-tech company, we recommend choosing a no-code platform. This will help your team monitor, analyze, and visualize KPIs without writing a single line of code.

Down the lane, we have curated a list of the best dashboard tools, some no-code, some low-code, and some with dedicated mobile apps. 

All of which you can find right here. üëáüèª
