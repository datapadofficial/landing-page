*The Istanbul-based startup has built cutting-edge AI Analyst Agents designed to replace traditional data analytics dashboards with proactive and constant KPI monitoring. Leading the investment was Pitchdrive, a renowned Belgian venture capital firm, with additional participation from prominent investors such as e2vc, Startup Istanbul, and several angel investors.*

The experienced founding team, Cem Ruso (who exited Blutv to Time Warner) and Orkun Soylu (ex-Insider), saw firsthand how difficult it is to create KPI visibility and a truly data-driven culture using the existing complex analytics solutions.

> *“Data is rapidly growing in size and complexity, making it incredibly tough, expensive, and time-consuming for an average business to build Business Analytics capabilities,”* said Ruso. *“We believe we can streamline and automate a majority of this process with autonomous AI agents. We basically want to take your data and tell you what’s working and what’s not.”*

Datapad supercharges human data analysts and decision-makers. Imagine you’re the CEO of a startup: you’ll be able to ask ad-hoc questions but also task the assistant to prepare scheduled periodic analyses for certain topics. The assistant will have a superhuman memory of all company historicals and will factor in external real-time context such as local holidays, competitor events, and industry benchmarks.

> *“The new breed of productivity software is becoming increasingly conversational,”* Soylu added. *“That’s why we’re focusing on building assistants that will be able to take a ‘brief’ and act on it on a periodic basis. A CEO will be able to give a ‘task’ to the agent and receive an in-depth analysis sent to their inbox a minute later.”*

Although Datapad users interact with just one chat, in the background there is a huge AI team of marketing, SEO, conversion rate optimization, and business strategy expert agents that work together to build the best analyses possible. Essentially, the core value surpasses data analysis and enters the realm of strategic recommendations.

> Ruso emphasizes: *“There’s a tectonic shift happening with analytics, and we foresee that more than 70% of all analytics content will be AI-driven in the next couple of years. With this new funding, we strongly believe that we will be the key driver of this transformation.”*

Datapad shows its international ambitions with this VC round while growing its 100+ customer database from all around the world.

> *“Cem and Orkun impressed us with their skills in building products people love. They found a very clear problem and turned the commodity that is AI today into an out-of-the-box solution. We can’t wait to see how Datapad will turn company analytics as we know it completely upside down.” - Koen, General Partner @ Pitchdrive VC*
