If you don't want to read the whole article, here a quick overview of best tools 🎥

![kpi dashboard tool factors to consider](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dGvUZTW4qr9RMGyIu72TLuTfJyc.png)

### #1. Software Onboarding and Ease of Use

Onboarding plays a crucial role in any KPI dashboard software. As a user, you must look for dashboard software that has product demos and guides that explain why and how to use the platform. Apart from this, the software should be easy to use.

The software should be intuitive and user-friendly so that users can quickly and easily understand and interact with the dashboard. 

The software should have a simple and clear user interface that makes it easy to navigate and understand the dashboard's data. Another important thing a KPI dashboard software must offer is customization options. Customization helps users tailor the dashboard to meet their specific needs. 

Lastly, the dashboard should be able to display data in an organized manner, allowing for quick and easy identification of important data points.

### #2. Integration Capabilities with Other Tools

Integration capabilities are important for KPI dashboard software because they allow it to connect with and pull data from other sources and systems. 

This is important because a KPI dashboard is often used to track and monitor various metrics and indicators that are relevant to the business, and these metrics and indicators may come from a variety of different sources.

For example, a KPI dashboard might track sales data from a customer relationship management (CRM) system, financial data from an accounting software, and employee productivity data from a project management tool. 

By integrating with these different systems, the KPI dashboard can automatically pull in data from these sources and display it in a single, unified view, making it easier for users to see and understand the data.

### #3. Dashboarding and Reporting Capabilities 

As a dashboard software, the primary goal of the tool is to create dashboards and help you track KPIs. 

But when selecting a software, ensure that it has enough templates for you to select the dashboard type (marketing, sales, operations, etc.). 

Another thing that’s good to have in a dashboard software is the capability of converting these KPI dashboards into reports that you can share with your team. 

### #4. Team Collaboration and Onboarding

Another feature to look for when selecting a KPI dashboard software is the tool's ability to bring teams onboard. When your business grows, so does your team. 

And when your team grows, you have the ability to track multiple KPIs for multiple teams (sales, marketing, production, manufacturing, etc.). 

So choose a software that lets you bring your team onboard in minutes, assign them dashboards or specific KPIs, and let them handle and track them as per their expertise.
