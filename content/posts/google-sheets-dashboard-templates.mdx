We reviewed all of the Google Sheets Dashboards templates available online to give you the best ones. 

In this article, you will find the best templates for different use cases.

But before we kick things off, let’s understand what Google Sheets Dashboard is.

## What Is a Google Sheets Dashboard?

Google sheets dashboards are used to store your kpis and metrics under one hub so that you can keep track of what’s happening in your company.

Dashboard are great for storing important data and visualising it so that your team have a place to monitor essential metrics for them.

![google sheets dashboard](https://framerusercontent.com/images/E0sS72Ld7WneDw3cBvYhqRws20.png)

In simple terms, suppose you have a pile of data waiting to be presented to teammates or stakeholders who prefer diagrams over numbers.

Now, processing the data manually might consume time, so Google Sheet dashboards help you quickly visualize your data via charts, graphs, pivot tables, and other stunning visualization tools.

However, GSheets are comparatively less advanced than [KPI tools](https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-tools).

Why is that?

GSheets dashboards don't actually qualify the dashboard-specific features to track [KPIs](https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics).

Instead, you need to do a lot of manual work to cope with the good work - GSheets have next to no automation.

But regardless of the limited customization and integration options in the Google Sheet dashboard, it does have an extensive library of dashboard templates to choose from. 

## Where Can I Download Google Sheets Templates?

Google Sheets offers a variety of dashboard templates ranging from educational to e-commerce templates.

## What is the Drawback of Using Google Sheets Dashboard Templates?

### Reason #1. It's All Manual

Google Sheets comes with next to no automation. That's bizarre because, being Google's prominent services, you expect it to be flawless.

But the sad truth is Google Sheets ain't a fully automated tool. For example, if you plan to automate your data input and tracking process, Google Sheets won't help you with any automation.

You need to manually input and edit every piece of data to your Google Sheet dashboard.

The most you can do is to create custom automation by playing with the script. However, that will require a certain level of coding skills. Your call! 

### Reason #2. Limited Functions and Formulas

We came across multiple customer reviews where they weren't impressed by the functions and formulas provided by Google Sheets dashboards.

![google sheets review](https://framerusercontent.com/images/7mbFSxfBBlyJpMAAvbfpdVeQvWo.png)

Coming to functionalities and formulas, we came across another customer who found it overly complex to work upon.

![google sheets user feedback ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/tJGpDMRnSYZYsPR5bK6NK9cQlA.png)

Google Sheets definitely have limited functions and formulas. Even certain add-ons cost you a dime sometimes.

### Reason #3. Few Integration Options

Google Sheets isn't very friendly with its third-party integrations.

**Pro Tip:** If you want optimum utilization of Google Sheets, it works best within Google's workspace - other integrations might pose problems.

However, if you are already set up with other applications, you might notice it takes extra time and syncs third-party tools with Google Sheets.

Till now, you might have understood how hard it is to [build a dashboard](https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-build-dashboard) on Google Sheets. Lucky for you, we have an easy, quick, and hassle-free solution for it.
