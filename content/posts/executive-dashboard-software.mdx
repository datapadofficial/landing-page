### Importance of Executive Dashboard Software

As of today, the digital world is producing over [2.5 quintillion](https://seedscientific.com/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/) (yup, a real number) bytes of data every day - that's eighteen zeros, to be specific.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/dylan-sprouse-big-daddy-cole-wbcMnfHqOJX9K)

This means organizations hold a treasure trove of knowledge at their fingertips: a treasure, if harnessed the right way, has the power to offer a competitive advantage, spark innovation, and create ever-evolving and well-oiled business strategies.

An executive dashboard software will help you do just that.

It will empower you to collect, organize, and analyze crucial business metrics while allowing you to beat the competition with better data-driven decision-making.

Besides, executive dashboard software connects relevant data sources with your existing systems, such as accounting software, customer relationship management (CRM) programs, email networks, and in-built website analytics.

With the help of these connectors, the software centralizes your data in one place, empowering you to view your business performance at once without logging into different platforms and mixing up valuable insights.

But not all executive dashboard software are worth your attention and time. Here are a few factors that make some dashboard software stand out from the crowd.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best Executive Dashboard Software

### #1. Is It Easy Enough for You to Set Up?

One of the most important factors to look for in an executive dashboard software is the ease of setup and learning curve. 

As we said earlier, c-suites have a lot on their plate and can't spend much time tracking KPIs.

Who wants to wait for their team to set a dashboard up in a couple of days while you can set up the tool in 5 minutes and start tracking your metrics, right?

So when finalizing your executive dashboard software, see to it that you can create dashboards in minutes and that there’s less to no manual work required to pull data in from multiple data sources.

### #2. Would It Give You Quick Access to Your Dashboards?

Being a part of the company's core management, you're expected to stay up-to-date with the company's performance. When you want a quick overview of a team’s performance, an executive dashboard will come in handy. But it will only be beneficial if you have quick access to your dashboard. 

### #3. On-the-Go Access?

It's a fact that the top executives of any organization have little freedom to be off the workplace, but that doesn't make them work less.

Since you're part of the decision-making committee, you must be able to track your business metrics from anywhere – from a beach 🏄‍♂️ in Bali to a comfy bathroom in your home.

To ensure you have access anytime and anywhere, look for software that offers mobile-friendly CX or a dedicated mobile app.

Now that you know what to look for in a typical executive dashboard software let's get through a list of the 9 best dashboard software for executives.
