## How to Create a Pie Chart in Google Sheets?

Down the lane, we have prepared a step-by-step guide on how to create a pie chart on Google Sheets.

Here’s a video tutorial of the whole process:

These columns are the building blocks of the pie chart. They communicate to the program what information needs to go inside the pie chart.

For instance, in our dataset, we have placed the data labels we desire in each slice of the pie in column A.

And then, in columns B and C, we added the numeric values we wanted to represent through the pie chart.

### Step 2: Create a Pie Chart from Your Database

Now that we have a dataset let's learn how to insert a pie chart in Google Sheets.

To get started, select the dataset (columns) you want to visualize.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/E3UgD86LgFlDfTvYNpzyQvAtA.png)

Then click on Insert in the menu bar.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/e7iCivACpwLbSRPpoHRjjT1kE.png)

A drop-down appears with a list of customization. Click on **Chart** to visualize your dataset.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/8aPYpMKf99yjYLwxrDMewFTKJ2I.png)

Google Sheets presents you with a default chart type to visualize your data as it did for our dataset 👇🏻

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/siICJQLAZmqpHOGYeFNutvWj9I8.png)

However, you can always change the chart type as you desire. To do so, click on **three vertical dots** in the top right corner of your default chart.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/BswH2hLR9ewtqa33hZedbtNHuw.png)

The Google Sheets in-built chart editor opens up on the right side of your sheet.

**Pro Tip:&#x20;**&#x59;ou can also double-click on the chart to open the editor directly.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/3u0mWPx9ixmREIfpejBgCvUwRhE.png)

Now, using the chart editor’s customize tab, you get access to plenty of ways to set up and customize your default chart type.

Let's first change the default chart type to a pie chart.

To do so, click on the **Chart Type** drop-down, scroll down a gallery of pre-built chart types, and halt near the **Pie Chart** section.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/J3kOkc8oJp361uvTBdoZ8eNJBM.png)

Here you're offered three pie chart options:

- **General Pie Chart:&#x20;**&#x41; simple pie chart divided into slices with labels and values

- **Doughnut Pie Chart:**  Similar to a pie chart, but can contain more than one data series

- **3D Pie Chart**: A 3-dimensional illustration of a pie chart

Click on your preferred chart type, and there you go!

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/nF9cQK6nh8Yi3ulvB8qKNdZXfYk.png)

Now that you know how to insert a pie chart in Google Sheets, let's now understand **how to set up a pie chart on Google Sheets**.

### Step 3: Set up Your Charts As per Your Preference

In the same section of the chart editor, right below the chart type drop-down, you will see setup elements like data range, labels, and values.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZkKndQklqH5fx4wQQZUKPQuOXV0.png)

Let's explore how each one serves the purpose.

#### #1. Date Range

Google Sheets is a dear friend of its novice users.

So even if you have visualized the wrong cells by mistake, you don't need to redo the whole process.

You can simply click on the **select data range** icon and change the existing data range or add another for visualization.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/E8cHudn665S49Rzdql1U9bS1M.png)

#### #2. Labels

Using this section, you can change the labels of your pie chart. For example, in our pie chart, we have used _Region_ as a label to present data on the chart.

However, you can choose to represent your pie chart using Sales numbers or other data categories (if any).

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/FK7ZD5NBWExXSzundrkmDHpMApY.png)

‍

#### #3. Values

Values, here, mean the values you want to display on a pie slice.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/VShpAwC9iihFJ6ZkQu7aMOQMQ.png)

If we want to display another value on the slices, let's say we want to show _% increase in sales_ as values on every slice. We'll click on the below title, and here's how it will go👇🏻

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/eG3feuK0CxZZR44RnqbSezQHug.png)

**Note:**  You must have another column with values in your dataset to get this option.

So until now, we saw how to create and set up a pie chart. In the next section, we’ll explore how to edit pie chart in Google Sheets.

### Step 4: Customize Your Pie Chart to Make It Look Better

In the chart editor, there's a **Customize** option beside the Setup menu. Right here👇🏻

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/qRHl6g4uu7bgp1CbRIKl2aeIOx4.png)

From here, you can customize every neck of the woods of your chart. Let's drill down the elements in the customizer one by one.

#### #1. Chart Style

Use the chart style section to custom format your pie chart's font style, background color, and borderline colors.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/zXIFnlLok3Emqy1HdjgqTAyJo.png)

Furthermore, you can also change the look and dimensions of your pie chart by ticking **Maximize** and **3D** check boxes.

#### #2. Pie Chart

This section offers some outlandish customizations. Like, you can put a doughnut hole in your pie chart. Yup, we're damn serious! 😮

Even though you opted for a general pie chart type, Gsheets still allow you to transform your chart into a doughnut pie chart.

Click on the **Donut Hole** drop-down and choose the percentage (area) of the hole.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QuHzHM2sGTouoHc0cKNqffx7Yc.png)

For instance, in our pie chart, we opted for **50%**, and here's how it looks.

‍

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UdAF14wKeQO6iIzDjK6LYsLvCpY.png)

Additionally, you can use the **Slice Label** drop-down to add labels/values/percentages to every pie chart slice. For example, we added Value to every slice, and here's what we got.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/6B65NwSHbUx5KuaWhtApBnlPJ5I.png)

**💭Food for thought:**  Isn't the pie chart getting better with every step?

#### #3. Pie Slice

From this section, you change the color of every slice in the pie chart.

Simply select a **Slice** > **Pick a color**, and it'll be displayed in real-time.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/i3r0peopIoIA0KVUuYjCtZ9HPLE.png)

Now let's understand how to change title of a pie chart in Google Sheets.

#### #4. Chart & Axis Titles

This section is all about it! From here, you can edit the chart titles and subtitles. Plus, you can even customize the font style, size, format, and colors.

#### #5. Legend

A legend helps you add meaning to your chart.

Let's be real, what's the purpose of creating a pie chart if we add too much text to explain it?

Let's take an example.

Previously our chart legend positioning was set on Auto or Labeled, and the chart looked like this.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/qUF7eH9ES28f0KLZaOeg5S80i9g.png)

Then we changed the positioning to the Bottom, and you can see the difference.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CXooCvVk74JvAyyQ10Skx7kLfUQ.png)

Moving forward, you can also change the legend font style, size, format, and color.

And that's the end of the ladder. You have successfully learned how do you make a pie chart on Google Sheets.

### Bonus Step: Export/Share a Pie Chart

You can share/export your pie chart in two ways:**Online and Offline.**

To share it offline, click on **File** in the top left corner of the menu bar.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/mNFmdv1LAU9waZZtS75gs9YivfA.png)

Then hover over **Download** to explore various downloading formats like Microsoft Excel, PDF, or CSV formats.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QJYduM7IkfjMUlBZ9N5RWJ3pn0.png)

Or, a better way is to Email the sheet to your stakeholders or team members directly.

## Drawbacks of Creating Pie Charts with Sheets

Although creating pie charts with Sheets is no rocket science, the process does involve certain limitations, such as:

### #1. Hard to Create on the Go

With Sheets, the process of creating pie charts gets complicated as the screen size reduces.

You see, although Gsheets offers a dedicated mobile app for users, doing the same process you just did on a laptop or PC would be difficult.

This is mainly because the UI/UX needs to be better optimized to be used on the go. You might often find it challenging to edit charts or encounter half-volley graphs in your Gsheet mobile app.

### #2. Time-Consuming

Unlike Datapad (our tool), Google Sheets offer limited automation. It's evident to you by the 5-step process we have discussed above.

Although the process is easy-to-do, at the same time, it's lengthy and time-consuming.

In fact, in sheets, data validation and preparation is labor-intensive, i.e., you need to manually double-check and re-enter any incorrect information.

**P.S.&#x20;**&#x4E;o wonder why it took so long for data analysts and marketers to visualize data via spreadsheets or even Google Sheets.

### #3. Isn't Aesthetically Pleasing

Of all the data visualizations provided by Gsheets, no one stands to be called 'stunning' or 'beautiful.'

Harsh but true!

Simply put, pie charts prepared in Gsheets aren't aesthetically pleasing for viewers. Factually, this was a major pain point considering which dashboarding tools like Datapad were created.

Datapad comparably offers much better, stunning, and pixel-perfect data visualization elements. Moreover, you can easily customize the look and feel of your charts using the in-built drag-and-drop builder.

So your chart look typically relies on your design perception.

### #4. Database Limitations

Most of us think that Sheets allow unlimited data storage.

Well, we don't disagree entirely. Gsheets offer a sufficient number of cells to collect and store databases of small companies that deal in tens and thousands of data.

However, at the same time, when dealing with millions and trillions of terabytes of data (which is typical for large-sized enterprises in today's data-driven world), Sheets won't be the right fit for you.

[As per reports](https://blog.golayer.io/google-sheets/google-sheets-limitations), Google Sheets limits you to 10,000,000 cells for new and converted documents.
