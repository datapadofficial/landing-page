Some of the best Whatagraph alternatives for quick access to KPIs are Datapad, Google Data Studio, Ortto, Raptor, Datadog, WYN Enterprise, Porter, Dataddo, Supermetrics, Oviond, and Scoro.

In this guide, you will find a full comparison between these Whatagraph alternatives and know why they are better than Whatagraph in some aspects.

## Why Might You Look for Whatagraph Alternatives?

### Reason #1. Poor Customer Service

![whatagraph g2 review -1 ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PJjyYQsnFFeNC7rCT0pmUVmQsmw.png)

When purchasing any tool, you need a strong support team who can solve your query quickly and efficiently.

Whatagraph seems to fail in both the departments - it’s neither quick nor efficient. 😪

They promise that they have a working customer support team in the US, but such is not the case.

Being a Europe-based company, people from the US and Canada find it extremely tough to get a timely reply, and many times the reply isn’t accurate, leading to irritated customers.

### Reason #2. Many Missing Features

When you pay for a service, you need it to be good, right? If a tool lacks core features when compared to its competitors, the tool doesn’t sustain the market for a longer time.

Such is our concern with Whatagraph. Customers have constantly complained about the software’s lack of features, improper features, and high learning curve.

Here’s what a customer posted on the review site Capterra about Whatagraph.

![whatagraph g2 review -2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/qx7UlR3UzDPFoo1hMN6JYMDsIVc.png)

### Reason #3. Major and Minor Bugs

![whatagraph g2 review -2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/rAkJMJRMs7QKvwxEdoJwmOKmzA.png)

Whatagraph has many bugs in its features 🐞. One major bug is its date filter. The date filter of the tool doesn’t work properly. And you must know how important a date filter is in any KPI dashboarding and reporting tool.

Apart from this, they also promise that you can integrate Whatagraph with Google Sheets, but it doesn’t happen.

The tool overall is more like a beta version with many bugs and issues that need fixing before launching it in the market for real customers.

## What are the Best Free Alternatives to Whatagraph?

- **Datapad: Best to track KPIs via mobile on the go**

- **Google Data Studio: Free tool for webmasters to track website KPIs**

- **Ortto: All-in-one marketing dashboard software for every business size**

- **Raport: A Whatagraph alternative with a low learning curve**

- **Datadog: Has a mobile app to track KPIs easily**

## #1. [Datapad](https://www.datapad.io/)

### How Does Datapad Compare to Whatagraph?

For starters, Whatagraph’s Google Sheets integration isn’t as seamless as Datapad. Some bugs need attention, and Whatagraph has failed to address them so far.

Unlike Datapad, Whatagraph doesn’t have a mobile app where you can create and track dashboards from anywhere in the world.

Whatagraph has pre-built templates, custom branding, and multiple integrations that Datapad lacks as it’s a comparatively new platform.
