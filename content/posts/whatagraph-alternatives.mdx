Some of the best Whatagraph alternatives for quick access to KPIs are Datapad, Google Data Studio, Ortto, Raptor, Datadog, WYN Enterprise, Porter, Dataddo, Supermetrics, Oviond, and Scoro.

In this guide, you will find a full comparison between these Whatagraph alternatives and know why they are better than Whatagraph in some aspects.

## Why Might You Look for Whatagraph Alternatives?

### Reason #1. Poor Customer Service

![whatagraph g2 review -1 ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PJjyYQsnFFeNC7rCT0pmUVmQsmw.png)

When purchasing any tool, you need a strong support team who can solve your query quickly and efficiently.

Whatagraph seems to fail in both the departments - it‚Äôs neither quick nor efficient. üò™

They promise that they have a working customer support team in the US, but such is not the case.

Being a Europe-based company, people from the US and Canada find it extremely tough to get a timely reply, and many times the reply isn‚Äôt accurate, leading to irritated customers.

### Reason #2. Many Missing Features

When you pay for a service, you need it to be good, right? If a tool lacks core features when compared to its competitors, the tool doesn‚Äôt sustain the market for a longer time.

Such is our concern with Whatagraph. Customers have constantly complained about the software‚Äôs lack of features, improper features, and high learning curve.

Here‚Äôs what a customer posted on the review site Capterra about Whatagraph.

![whatagraph g2 review -2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/qx7UlR3UzDPFoo1hMN6JYMDsIVc.png)

### Reason #3. Major and Minor Bugs

![whatagraph g2 review -2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/rAkJMJRMs7QKvwxEdoJwmOKmzA.png)

Whatagraph has many bugs in its features üêû. One major bug is its date filter. The date filter of the tool doesn‚Äôt work properly. And you must know how important a date filter is in any KPI dashboarding and reporting tool.

Apart from this, they also promise that you can integrate Whatagraph with Google Sheets, but it doesn‚Äôt happen.

The tool overall is more like a beta version with many bugs and issues that need fixing before launching it in the market for real customers.

## What are the Best Free Alternatives to Whatagraph?

1. **Datapad: Best to track KPIs via mobile on the go**

2. **Google Data Studio: Free tool for webmasters to track website KPIs**

3. **Ortto: All-in-one marketing dashboard software for every business size**

5. **Datadog: Has a mobile app to track KPIs easily**

## #1. [Datapad](https://www.datapad.io/)

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png)

[Datapad](https://www.datapad.io/) helps you track all essential [metrics ](https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics)from stunning dashboards.

The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use. With our tool, anyone in your team with zero technical knowledge can start building reports in mere seconds.

### Key Feature #1. Templates

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/m7rLbpP0wFAeaQMSOB7G5u9Kuis.png)

Creating reports for your business is no easy task. You have to determine a lot, from which metrics to choose to design the right charts.

If you are an agency and want to create the same reports for multiple clients, then this hassle becomes even more burdensome.

Guess what? Datapad lets you do all this with just a few clicks.

With Datapad's templating features, you can:

- Choose from a gallery of pre-designed templates and apply them with 1-click

- Build a custom dashboard and re-use it as a template by changing it's sources

- Share all connected data sources in the workspace with your teammates

### ‚ÄçKey Feature #2. Team Collaboration

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/lfMtGJd62Mic0PYHmbTCMfmPDNY.png)

Tracking KPIs isn't a one-person job when you have a lot of them; you need a team. But not all KPI dashboard tools let you bring your team on board. 

Guess what? Datapad lets you do it quickly and easily. 

Moreover, you can assign individual team members tasks to handle, goals to achieve, and metrics to measure.

With Datapad's team collaboration feature, you can:

### How Does Datapad Compare to Whatagraph?

For starters, Whatagraph‚Äôs Google Sheets integration isn‚Äôt as seamless as Datapad. Some bugs need attention, and Whatagraph has failed to address them so far.

Unlike Datapad, Whatagraph doesn‚Äôt have a mobile app where you can create and track dashboards from anywhere in the world.

Datapad also lets you search KPIs via its search bar features, and Whatagraph lacks this feature as well.

Whatagraph has pre-built templates, custom branding, and multiple integrations that Datapad lacks as it‚Äôs a comparatively new platform.
