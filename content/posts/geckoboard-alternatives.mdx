*But before we start!*

If you’re short on time, here’s a tl;dr of the best tools you can use to replace Geckoboard:

![Geckoboard alternatives comparison table](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dlQBu07ZJQ3sT59HFAQLg4zeL4.png)

‍

We will cover the features of every alternative mentioned above in detail, but before we do that, let’s look at some potential reasons to switch from Geckoboard to another dashboard tool.

Before we begin here is a short video for you:

![G2 negative Geckoboard review](https://framerusercontent.com/images/AtZQgXzzp5fncU6uOQZp0d0rPs.png)

It’s no secret that everyone starts small, but when you decide to scale your business and create multiple dashboards to track multiple SKUs, Geckoboard could burn a hole in your pocket.

How?

Suppose you want to onboard 20 team members and build 30 dashboards for your company. If you plan to track [KPIs](https://www.datapad.io/blog/what-is-a-kpi) with Geckoboard, do you know how much it would cost?

You will have to go with Geckoboard’s Scale plan for 30 dashboards, and that’s $699/month.

Why pay so much when you have several Geckoboard competitors to try out in the market?

### Reason #2: Poor Customization Features

When it comes to KPI tracking, customization is a prominent feature to look for. 

![G2 negative geckoboard review - 2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PPTCOFadHtkDvnr437CKuFcBUY8.png)

To build a highly personalized[ KPI dashboard](https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-dashboard-software), you must use a tool that lets you create a dashboard from scratch and customize it the way you want.

Let’s imagine you are the CEO of an email marketing agency and have multiple clients. 

It’s a no-brainer that every client will demand tracking of different KPIs that they think might make or break their email campaigns. If you tell them you can’t do that, you will probably lose the client.

So why wait for this to happen if you can just switch to a better Geckoboard alternative right away.

### Reason #3: Lacks Premium Features that Other Software Have

Geckoboard lacks some premium features like Shopify filters and has relatively less data from Instagram.

Shopify is the biggest source for merchants to launch their eCommerce stores.

It’s the most used platform in the US and holds a market share of 31%.

![pie chart for ecommerce technologies being used](https://framerusercontent.com/images/iBD2JN0aULzS3XxXVWzdhzqro8.png)

[Source](https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/country/United-States)

KPI tracking is one of the primary objectives of any eCommerce store, no matter the niche they’re in; that’s how they track, scale, and become profitable.

Unfortunately, Geckoboard just has a handful of Shopify filters - not enough to dig deep into the data.

One other feature that needs attention is data pulling from Instagram. The platform has this feature but lacks depth.

People love shopping on Instagram. [According to Hootsuite](https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/), 44% of active Instagram users use it to shop weekly; that’s huge!

Apart from the three major drawbacks above, there are some others as well. 

For example:

- You can only display data points that Geckoboard sets

- The dashboard might lose connection anytime, which can lead to data loss

- Google sheets or any other spreadsheets might lose their formatting during integration

When it comes to functionality, Geckoboard is limited and offers basic KPI tracking dashboards. It lacks complex features and isn’t pocket-friendly. 

Over the years, we’ve tested some free as well as paid KPI dashboards and curated a list of top software that can serve as a great Geckoboard alternative.

Let’s start with the free ones.

## 4 Best Free Geckoboard Alternatives
