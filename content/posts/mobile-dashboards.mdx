‚Äç[According to BankMyCell](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world), around 83% of the population currently owns a mobile phone. 

So, when we talk about analyzing important business information, what do you think is the better platform - a heavily wired desktops or a dashboard on mobile?

Here‚Äôs a scenario that might help you direct toward the right answer:

Imagine you‚Äôre on a beach in California, chilling with a beer in your hand by the sun. üèñÔ∏è

Suddenly, you get a text on Slack from your team. They're panicking as one of your business KPIs is acting all strange and your team has no idea what to do! üò≥

What do you do?

Will you just book the next flight home and get there to resolve the issue?

Nah!

Instead, have a mobile app to track your KPIs so you can observe, analyze, and communicate to your teammates how to tackle the situation while sitting on a beach.

This way you still get to enjoy the chilled beer by the beach while your team resolves the issue as you suggest to them and keep you in the loop. üòâ 

All this because you have a mobile dashboard to track KPIs right away!

In this article, you'll discover what mobile dashboards are, their benefits, and how to track KPIs via mobile dashboards using our app Datapad.

## What is a Mobile Dashboard?

A mobile dashboard is a data analytics tool that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics on mobile. 

It‚Äôs an insightful console that provides access to all the KPIs related to your business from several data sources at your fingertips so that you can make educated business decisions on the go.

Let‚Äôs show you an example to understand better.

With the mobile dashboards, you can get real-time data about your car's security if you have integrated the GPS into your mobile. 

The GPS dashboard provides remote access to your car‚Äôs speed, the last location, stoppage time, and many more things to keep you updated.  

### Components of Mobile Dashboard

Here are some components that go into the making of a mobile dashboard:

- **Data Sources:**  The data source could be a database, file, or live data feed. Consider an example of an e-commerce website. To display the information on the products, the website gets information from the inventory database. That makes the inventory database a source of data.

- **Data Visualization Elements:&#x20;**&#x44;ata visualization is a visual representation of data in simple charts, graphs, and maps. It's a unique combination of art and science that assist the users in discovering patterns that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.

- **Filters:&#x20;**&#x46;ilters are a crucial part of mobile dashboards. It helps to narrow down the results so that the end user can focus on the most important metrics. For example, applying a gender-specific filter to a dashboard that covers population data will only display the male or female population on the same dashboard.

- **KPI:&#x20;**&#x4B;ey performance indicators are the quantifiable metrics that identify and gauge the success of an organization against its business objectives. KPIs provide targets and insights that help organizations foster continual growth.

- **Dashboard Menu:**  Dashboard menu allows you to create, save and open new dashboards. You can invoke all the other dashboard settings by clicking on the dashboard menu option.

Now that you know what the components of a mobile dashboard are, let's look at why they're comparatively comfortable in tracking KPIs.

### How Are Mobile Dashboards Better than Desktop Dashboards?

There are two key differences between mobile dashboards and dashboards specially built for desktops. Let's have a look at them.

#### #1. Mobile Dashboard Designs Are Superior than Desktop's

The desktop has relatively more screen real estate than a mobile. Sometimes, that could tempt the dashboard designer to overwhelm it with information, which could be hard on the eyes. 

On the flip side, due to its limited screen size, a mobile dashboard only contains key outliers and the most important KPIs. This way, it's easier for mobile users to scan through the vital data and act on it immediately.

#### #2. Ease of Access

A robust mobile dashboard can amplify your business by providing interactively remote access to high-level KPIs. But the desktop dashboard demands a wired connection to display data, limiting the data accessibility reach.

Although we compared the two dashboards (mobile and desktop) to find the better one, if you want the best of both worlds, ensure that both the platforms are in tandem with one another.

Anyways, let‚Äôs talk a little bit more about mobile dashboards.

Just smashing random KPIs on a mobile dashboard won‚Äôt do the job. There are some tips and tricks to follow that‚Äôd help you track KPIs better.

Let‚Äôs see what those are!

## Best Practices to Follow While Building Mobile Dashboards

There are three things to take care of while designing a mobile business dashboard:

- Easy to read 

- Intuitive design 

- Contains only the most relevant information

To make this a process of success so that you and your team actually find what you're looking for, you need to follow certain design practices that include:

### #1. Responsive Design

Selecting a mobile tracking KPI software with a responsive [dashboard design](https://www.datapad.io/blog/dashboard-design) is crucial. 

Responsive designs enable the dashboards to resize the screen according to various devices like smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. 

It allows the user to control which data needs to be in the limelight and what KPIs can be seen later after scrolling..

### #2. Less of a Mess

Select a mobile KPI dashboard software that lets you make the best use of your mobile phone screens.

Having a simple and intuitive designed dashboard that has minimum clutter gives you easy access to dashboard elements. 

This increases the overall productivity as it allows you and the team members to focus on key metrics.

### #3. Wise Use of Filters

Filters help to narrow down the results so that you can focus on what you decide to do. 

However, we highly recommend avoiding an app that uses multiple filters on mobile screens. 

Select the one that has minimum filters on mobile devices. This stops the screen from getting cluttered and enhances the overall user experience.

**Note:**  Use of multiple filters on a mobile device can drain your mobile battery and slow down the KPI tracking by slowing down the load speed.

### #4. Consistency

It can be confusing for you to look at varying user interfaces and layouts of a business dashboard. Thus, being consistent with the design and layouts is deemed as one of the best practices when designing the elements of a mobile dashboard.

### #5. First Things First

Overdoing the dashboard with too many flashy graphs and data points will create unnecessary confusion. 

To avoid such situations, try having the most important KPIs on the top of your screen. You should have a proper understanding of how to prioritize your KPIs for different teams in your department.

Doing so enables a simplified view of the dashboard elements, which results in faster and more accurate decision-making.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x49;f you have a bunch of KPIs and no other option but to track them all via a single dashboard. Keep the KPIs that you track quarterly and yearly below the ones you track daily or monthly. This way you won‚Äôt find yourself scrolling frequently.

## What are the Benefits When You View Dashboards on Mobile?

As we saw, the mobile dashboard can take your business to higher levels by offering several pivotal insights in an interactive manner. 

Moreover, you can access your data from anywhere you want, which alone makes it an incredible plus point for businesses to invest in. 

But wait, there‚Äôs more!

Now it‚Äôs time we delve deeper into some real-time benefits of a mobile dashboard.

### #1. Real-Time Access

Traditional dashboard design demands a hard-wired connection to provide access to data. This limits the users from getting real-time developments on data points which in turn results in ineffective business decisions. 

When you start tracking KPIs on mobile, you can immediately access the desired data from anywhere you want. 

This broadens the limits of data accessibility which helps you and your team to track and act on KPIs from anywhere in the world.

### #2. Accurate Decision Making

By providing real-time information into a mobile dashboard, it's easier to extrapolate and make sense of trends, promoting swift and accurate decisions. This leads to more productive results and enhances the overall business operation. 

For example, imagine a law firm hiring legal associates. 

The executive of the company may use a real-time mobile dashboard that provides the individual with a comparative view of different parameters like competence, legal internship scores, etc, needed to judge the best among the pool of associates. 

This can speed up the decision-making process as there‚Äôs enough data to come to a conclusion.  

### #3. Innovative Business Models

As mobile dashboards provide instant access to powerful analytics almost anywhere, organizations will likely incorporate it into their strategic planning to create innovative business models. 

For example, by integrating a mobile app portfolio into their business model, a bakery company easily accesses real-time information on what its hot selling products are.   

### #4. Sharing

As employees get to easily analyze and communicate vital business metrics in a flexible manner, it allows them to make more informed decisions than before. This way, a mobile dashboard contributes to the accelerated growth and evolution of an organization.  

## Mobile App Dashboard Examples
