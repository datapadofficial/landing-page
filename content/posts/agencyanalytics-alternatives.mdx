## 3 Reasons Why You Might Need an Agency Analytics Alternative?

### #1. Poor Automated Reporting

A vital component of any marketing reporting tool is a user-friendly interface. However, Agency Analytics fails to provide it.

We came across reviews of the reporting interface being limited, clunky, and challenging to be worked upon. 

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/AiXbFDMpXAgdyUtEiTS3aEbaqw.png)

Besides a steep learning curve due to its poor interface, Agency Analytics also fails to provide not-so-user-friendly reports, which means that the cover pages of reports are unattractive. 

And, you can’t simply do anything to enhance it because of the limitations in customization options.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/8IUKJHH4eCvZ6iMiknxBBm7kqA.png)

Moreover, you can’t present insights on a live report. We mean that even if you add insights to a report template, you can’t show live data on the report.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/YC1zEIYqs43OvQYuZ5ZwwJXhYv0.png)

### #2. Unfavorable Pricing

Agency Analytics revolves around a ‘per campaign basis’ pricing model.

For example, the starter plan, best for freelancers, is priced at $10/month/client campaign. The said price is accessible with a minimum purchase of 5 client campaigns.

While the agency plan is priced at $15/month/client campaign, with a minimum purchase of 10 client campaigns.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/SfgMA301xzQQbbfk2nWKrikcdM.png)

Overall, the pricing is not as competitive as we expect it to be. The per-client model pricing can burn a hole in your pocket if you want to scale from 1 to 100 clients.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DqZ3LtRA1C8uBQlCxa2d6gCMRk.png)

### #3. Lack of Personalization Options

Another reason to opt for Agency Analytics alternatives is the lack of white-labeling options.

The platform comes with a single white-label logo option, which isn't what many customers expect.

For the most part of it, personalizing your reports and marketing dashboards for your customers can be a great deal. But unfortunately, Agency Analytics doesn't stand at par with the expectations.

Now that you know why you need an Agency Analytics alternative, it’s time to explore your options.
