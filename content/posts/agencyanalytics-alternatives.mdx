We reviewed some of the best Agency Analytics alternatives, including Datapad, MatricsWatch, Swydo, Report Garden, OWOX, Singular, Reportz, Whatsgraph, and Oviond.

In this article, we have discussed all these free and paid alternatives, best for usage, and key features. 

We have also discussed how these platforms can help you create stunning dashboards, drill down data, and help in better decision-making by providing actionable insights, even better than Agency Analytics.

## 3 Reasons Why You Might Need an Agency Analytics Alternative?

### #1. Poor Automated Reporting

A vital component of any marketing reporting tool is a user-friendly interface. However, Agency Analytics fails to provide it.

We came across reviews of the reporting interface being limited, clunky, and challenging to be worked upon. 

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/AiXbFDMpXAgdyUtEiTS3aEbaqw.png)

Besides a steep learning curve due to its poor interface, Agency Analytics also fails to provide not-so-user-friendly reports, which means that the cover pages of reports are unattractive. 

And, you can’t simply do anything to enhance it because of the limitations in customization options.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/8IUKJHH4eCvZ6iMiknxBBm7kqA.png)

Moreover, you can’t present insights on a live report. We mean that even if you add insights to a report template, you can’t show live data on the report.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/YC1zEIYqs43OvQYuZ5ZwwJXhYv0.png)

### #2. Unfavorable Pricing

Agency Analytics revolves around a ‘per campaign basis’ pricing model.

For example, the starter plan, best for freelancers, is priced at $10/month/client campaign. The said price is accessible with a minimum purchase of 5 client campaigns.

While the agency plan is priced at $15/month/client campaign, with a minimum purchase of 10 client campaigns.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/SfgMA301xzQQbbfk2nWKrikcdM.png)

Overall, the pricing is not as competitive as we expect it to be. The per-client model pricing can burn a hole in your pocket if you want to scale from 1 to 100 clients.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DqZ3LtRA1C8uBQlCxa2d6gCMRk.png)

### #3. Lack of Personalization Options

Another reason to opt for Agency Analytics alternatives is the lack of white-labeling options.

The platform comes with a single white-label logo option, which isn't what many customers expect.

For the most part of it, personalizing your reports and marketing dashboards for your customers can be a great deal. But unfortunately, Agency Analytics doesn't stand at par with the expectations.

Now that you know why you need an Agency Analytics alternative, it’s time to explore your options.
