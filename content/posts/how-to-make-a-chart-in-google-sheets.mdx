## What are the Types of Charts You Can Create in Google Sheets?

Google Sheets offers a gallery of various chart types for data visualization. Below we have curated a detailed list of all the available chart styles and types and also laid emphasis on how to use chart in Google sheets in the best possible way.

### #1. Line Chart

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/K5njqO7LNYxyZXC8Fo5Ycum7Q.png)

[Line charts in google sheets](http://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-make-a-line-chart-in-google-sheets) are typically used to show changes in trends over time. These chart types are created by plotting several points on the chart and then connecting dots via singular lines.

#### Best Use Case of Line Chart

Ideal for showing trends in sales or profit margin over a month, quarter, or year. For example, annual home loans, monthly subscription revenue, etc.

### #2. Combo Chart

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/pDtle83hSkyjCUZagJlrFnH3nU.png)

As the name suggests, a combo or combination chart is a mix of line charts and bar graphs used to visualize contrast datasets.This allows users to display different types of data in a single chart, such as a line chart and a column chart, to compare different sets of data more effectively.

#### Best Use Case of Combo Charts

Combo charts are best to use when you want to highlight each data series with a different marker within the same chart.

For example, a combination chart is an excellent choice if you want to showcase the monthly revenue and % increase in profit margins on the same graph.

### #3. Area Chart

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/hYyDMHOFXoi4X6PP2nTQA2935s.png)

Like line charts, area charts help you compare one or more data series graphically. They allow you to determine the change in trends over different data categories.

The difference is that the area chart uses shades below the line to showcase the magnitude of trends.

#### Best Use Case of Area Chart

It's best used to showcase data that depict a time-series relationship, for example:

- Compare revenue and expenses over time

- Compare the volume of imports and exports every month

### #4. Column Chart

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/9wi88TG0Ac47T9uQF7axcFE1U.png)

A column chart helps you display different categories or groups of data using rectangular or vertical bar charts. Moreover, it helps you easily compare values of different data series over time.

Google Sheets provide two types of column charts

- **Stacked column chart:**  To showcase a part-to-whole relationship

- **100% Stacked column chart:**  To show relationships and trends when the cumulative total isn't important

#### Best Use of Column Charts

Marketers and data analysts widely use column charts to perform comparative analyses. Ideally, a column chart is a good fit for tracking, measuring, and comparing 10-12 datasets at once.

### #5. Bar Graph

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CACJjo7f26UBRNmzbft2f6mKmM.png)

A bar graph is a graphical representation of data using vertical or horizontal bars or strips to compare the difference between two or more data points or groups.

#### Best Use Case of Bar Graph

Bar graphs are typically used to compare individual items. Some of its use cases include:

- Compare ticket sales by location

- Breakdown of employees by job titles

- Compare % of website traffic from different sources

### #6. Pie Chart

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dc3remQKn9VtntsVrqnlZV7v68.png)

Pie chart is a type of chart in which a full-drawn circle is divided into several slices or portions, each representing a part-to-the-whole.

#### Best Use of Pie Chart

A pie chart can only be used if the cumulative total of individual slices adds to a meaningful total. Some of its use cases include:

- Showing percentages of types of customers

- Percentage of revenue from different products

- Region-wise sales of a particular product

### #7. Scatter Chart

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CjMllz5WCwmC13IzNM0s8Elo48.png)

A scatter chart shows numeric coordinates along the horizontal (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis) axes and helps viewers easily understand the relationship between two variables.

#### Best Use of Scatter Chart

Scatter charts are best to use when you want to find out how one variable is affecting another. For example:

- Salary of employees vs. years of experience

- Ice cream sales vs. temperature

- Revenue vs. expenses

## How to Create a Chart in Google Sheets?

To those who always ask us, ‚Äú_how do I create a chart in Google sheets_?‚Äù

Peeps, we‚Äôve finally come up with the easiest step-by-step guide on how to make a data chart in Google Sheets.

So without further delay; Let‚Äôs dive in üòÑ

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DeD5gi2K7Gt3m2iadS7mkswhSc.png)

For this article, we've created a simple dataset to help you quickly understand how to chart data in Google Sheets.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Q1K6YqoOx2qjxKTl9EF5dE6Px8.png)

Here, column A depicts the time series, while column B represents the values corresponding to specific time periods, and C represents the profit each year.

**Note:**  To create a chart, you must have at least two primary columns. The first one has a timeframe, and the second column has the values you want to visualize.You can also have three or more columns for combination chart types.

### Step #2. Create a Chart From Your Dataset

Now that we have a dataset, let's learn how to add a chart in Google Sheets.

For initials, select the dataset (columns) you want to present via chart.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/RKJ4bziAdOshVdmxA26jaxELyE.png)

To insert chart in Sheets, click o&#x6E;**&#x20;Insert** in the menu bar.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/MI8rkk7BRBpcGs9GOFZk85XjlE.png)

A drop-down appears with a list of elements. Click on **Chart** and that‚Äôs it.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/rPq5iNhD2lYseVs6BB9kzjyBFPU.png)

Google Spreadsheets automatically presents you with a default chart type to visualize your data as it did for our dataset with a line chart üëáüèª

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CgihSOIhttqBiq4FVH2eFxMKVUU.png)

So, this was how to add a chart in Google sheets. Moving forward, we'll learn how you can change the default chart type and visualize your dataset as you desire.

### Step #3. Change the Default Chart Type

We feel this is the best part of creating charts on Sheets. You can instantly change the chart type as per your preference.

To do so, **Click** on the chart and then click on the **Three vertical dots** in the top right corner.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/dEPAofKmMTDKS4Cv6R5Y6j3NEW8.png)

Then click on **Edit Chart** to open Gsheet's in-built Chart Editor on the right sidebar.

**Pro Tip:**  You can also double-click on the chart to open the editor directly.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/d9sw2anaMoGax3X33nYjl8qkDA.png)

In the chart editor, click on the **Chart Type** drop-down to access a gallery of pre-built templates and charts from Sheets.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ajL26thOAu4DvtIjyOp9Amlt4g.png)

Here, the first section comprises chart suggestions from Gsheets. You can choose a chart type from there or a completely different one from the gallery. Your call! ü§ôüèª

When you have made a choice, simply click on the chart icon, and your existing chart will be replaced with your chosen one in real time.

As an example, we tried representing our dataset using a column graph. So, we scrolled down the gallery and clicked on the **Column Chart** icon üëáüèª

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/2fumfS4BAmSlaCuTmCNunU4Bk.png)

So this is how to add chart in Google sheets. In the next step, we‚Äôll discuss how you can edit or customize a chart in the app.

### Step #4. Custom Format Chart As Per Your Preference

To customize your bar graph, click on the **Customize** menu in the chart editor.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/5p3Yk5gb1DiJ1IXbWGNoXVwJ2M.svg)

Here‚Äôs what you can do with the customization option:

- Change data range

- Change axis labels, axis titles, and sub-headers

- Include / exclude gridlines

- Interchange horizontal axis and vertical axis

And that's it!

You now know how to make chart on Google Sheets. However, when you perform the practice in real life, you may encounter certain drawbacks of using Gsheets.

## Drawbacks of Creating Charts with Sheets

### #1. Not a Mobile Friendly Platform

As part of the superior services provided by Google, we expect Google sheets to stand tall on all grounds. üèÜ

However, when it comes to using Gsheets on your mobile devices, you can find it uncomfortable.

You see, creating charts on Gsheets desktop version vs. mobile version can trigger completely different experiences for users.

Although the platform has a dedicated mobile app, users may still find it challenging to create charts on the go. You may ask why?

The Google Sheets mobile app isn't well-optimized to function perfectly on small screen devices.

In fact, within seconds into the app, and you‚Äôll likely encounter one of these:

- Difficult to scroll through the sheet

- Half-volley graphs

- Complications in managing and visualizing data

### #2. Might Get Slow When Processing Huge Datasets

Another noticeable drawback of Gsheets is its inability to process heft databases.

Although Gsheets offer [10,000,000 cells](https://blog.golayer.io/google-sheets/google-sheets-limitations) to collect and organize data, it won't take you that long to figure out that your application has already slowed down. üêå

And this becomes problematic for large companies that generally deal with terabytes of user data.

When such companies use Gsheets, they are constantly under threat of data security and integrity.

### #3. Limited Number of Customizations

Google Sheets offer a countable number of customization options. Unlike the modern-day chart creation tools, Sheets allows you to perform basic customization to your charts.

On the other hand, Datapad (our tool) provides tons of pre-built charts, tables, graphs, and widgets for hassle-free data visualization _(more on this later)_.

### #4. Limited Data Import Options

Sheets offer next to no integration options. This means you can import data in just two ways:

- By importing another spreadsheet that has data

- By manually entering the data labels and values

While modern-day dashboard and chart creation tools like Datapad allow you to import data from various data sources and platforms with a click.

You might be wondering what‚Äôs the buzz around Datapad. üêù

Well! See for yourself in the next section. üòâ
