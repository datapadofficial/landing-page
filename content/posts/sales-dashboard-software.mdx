## What Is Sales Dashboard Software? 

A sales dashboard software is a platform that allows you to collect, monitor, and visualize all your sales-related KPIs and metrics. 

The software provides a quick overview of your company's performance in context with revenue, leads, conversion rates, monthly/annual profits, and sales growth. 📈

Basically, it uses a combination of visual aids to represent these data in an easy-to-understand format. You can even create your own sales dashboard, but that might consume time, and on another note, it's unnecessary when you have plenty of options to automate the process.

But why do you actually need a sales dashboard software? 🤔

A typical sales dashboard software helps you streamline your sales funnel and pipeline, thereby allowing you to gather valuable insights into your sales performance.

For small to medium-sized companies, managing the sales process becomes daunting at times.

However, implementing the right dashboard solution can help you save time and resources, and also minimizes the risk of human errors.

At this stage, cherry-picking a software is what you must avoid because there are several sales dashboard software in the market boasting about their perfection.

So, how do you choose the best software for your business without getting honey trapped?

Here are a few factors to be considered when choosing a sales dashboard solution for progressive sales teams.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best Marketing Dashboard Software

### #1. Is It Easy Enough for You to Set Up?

The setup process for any dashboard solution involves many phases: Connectivity to data points, setting up key performance indicators, onboarding team members, and more.

In most cases, it might take hours or even days to get your dashboard up and running.

In sales, where every day is a do-or-die game, you must cast around a software that requires minimal effort to set up. Besides, ensure that your team shouldn't have to spend much time training for using the software.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/latenightseth-boom-3o7btNa0RUYa5E7iiQ)

**Pro Tip:** Check for the software reviews and ratings online. Focus on three major aspects: Ease of setup, learning curve, and availability of training materials.                                                                                       

### #2. Would It Give You Quick Access to Your Dashboards?

Being part of a dynamic market where uncertainties are not uncommon, your dashboard should be handy. Not literally, but you should be able to access it instantly from anywhere.

This, especially, is beneficial for people with offline sales, like real estate agents or retail store owners. Imagine trying to access a specific metric, say monthly sales revenue, only to find out you lost it in the crowd of other KPIs.

By quick access, we also mean that dashboarding software must make available your desired KPIs within seconds, not even minutes ⏳.

Typically, it can be achieved if the software has NLP (Natural Language Processing) or advanced search features.

### #3. On the Go Access?

As said, sales is a time-sensitive matter, and people always want to check numbers quite often.

Even when they are off work, traveling, or spending quality time on vacation – the curiosity to check sales numbers never mellows out. 🧐

To access your sales dashboard on the go, ensure that the software you are choosing isn't desktop-ridden. Fortunately, there are plenty of tools in the market that offer mobile-friendly solutions.

Using a mobile-friendly software allows instant access to your sales dashboard anytime and anywhere. So, having a mobile-friendly tool is best in any scenario.

Now that we know what factors comply with a great sales dashboard software, here's a list of 11 software that we thought would be a perfect fit for your sales team.
