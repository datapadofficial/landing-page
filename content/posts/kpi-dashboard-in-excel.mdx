Fictionally, Excel has been the godfather since the era of old-age computers; there's no doubt about it.

When it comes to dashboards, you can create them in Excel to track KPIs and drill-down on data.

Being the oldest data management system, it's always a wise choice for creating KPI dashboards.

In this article, we'll learn how to build a KPI dashboard in Excel in five easy steps. We'll also drill down the drawbacks of Excel for dashboard creation and explore its next-best alternative.

So let’s take it from the top!

## What Is a KPI Dashboard in Excel? 

**Excel KPI dashboard** is where metrics and KPIs are stored and visualized under a spreadsheet. Dashboards are used to keep crucial data under one hub for easy tracking

Dashboards created in Excel are single page (mostly, but not always). They help you track your business progress via in-built charts, tables, and views that are backed by data.

![excel kpi dashboard](https://framerusercontent.com/images/FLxdLdnN66V4UkQS3pvYuPCyoN0.png)

But creating a KPI dashboard in Excel comes with unwanted challenges and requires a steady eye for long hours. However, we've tried to drill down the dashboard creation process in five simple steps.

## How to Create a KPI Dashboard in Excel - Step-by-Step Guide

Creating interactive dashboards in Excel can be tiring, and there are a few steps to take before finally stepping up on the boat.

Here’s a tutorial on how to do it:

![import data to excel](https://framerusercontent.com/images/xFPCrRck95NG41B58vTwxKNyJss.gif)

**Pro Tip:&#x20;**&#x55;se conditional formatting to improve readability of raw data.

### Step 3: Start With Data Cleansing and Filtering

The data you imported in the previous step is called raw data. For creating a reliable dashboard, raw data is something you would hate to put in.

Fortunately, Excel comes with tools to ease your data cleansing process. For example, we have manually put a data set representing monthly sales.

![excel data filtering](https://framerusercontent.com/images/BrO4IXRDdfvFZVdoHfg3o6sTBc.png)

To polish data, Excel can help you with:

- **Alignment:**  Align your data in ascending or descending order

- **Custom Sorting:**  Sort data by column, value, color, font color, and order

- **Data Filtering:&#x20;**&#x41;dd an advanced filtering widget to each column

- **Remove Duplicates**: Removes any duplicate data

### Step 4: Visualize Your Data

Now that we've factual data with us. Let's get started with the next big step, which is - data visualizations.

For this, simply select the cells you want to add in the graph and click on **Insert** to present your data via charts and diagrams.

![excel chart creation](https://framerusercontent.com/images/A6a0VUnAGMjJDyOM3bVIyhSzAYc.gif)

Excel gives you multiple chart choices to select from; bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs, and other visualizations. While assigning charts for your data, keep these things in mind:

- Use combination charts to compare values and draw meaningful insights

- Use dynamic charts if you want to make selections and want the chart to update with it

- Use sparklines when you want to show a trend over time and, at the same time, save space on your dashboard

Next, easily customize the chart/axes titles, data labels, colors, and data table via the chart formatting option.

![excel chart formatting](https://framerusercontent.com/images/YsLErVUCpQtOnTi3p2JMaNq3qsM.png)

Once you’re done with the customization, it's time to prepare a full-fledged dashboard.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x59;ou can also use pivot tables in your dashboard if you need them.

### Step 5: Create a Full Fledged Dashboard

Although you have already worked on visualizing your data, keeping raw data and visuals on the same sheet can be confusing.

Do you remember we mentioned how to create a sub sheet in Excel? 🤔

In the same way, create another sub sheet in the same workbook and name it something as "**KPI Dashboard**." 

You can copy and paste all the graphs on the new sub sheet and track them there. 

![excel dashboards](https://framerusercontent.com/images/z6cOaO9W2GNhwg0WLG0gaQdWE8.png)

**Note:**  Copy-pasting charts from one sub sheet to another is a manual process, which will take time. If you want to track KPIs via excel, there’s no way around it.

You and your team can use this sheet as a major KPI dashboard. Doing this helps you in three ways:

- You get a whole screen for displaying multiple data visualizations

- You can choose who can access/view/edit the raw data sheet

- If you make changes or edit the raw data, it will automatically be updated in the key performance indicator dashboard sheet 

That's it, you have successfully created your first KPI dashboard in Excel.

However, to ease your burden, we have curated a list of some free [excel dashboard ](https://www.datapad.io/blog/excel-dashboard)templates. Let's have a look at them.

## Drawbacks of Building KPI Dashboards in Excel

Despite the free kpi templates in excel, it becomes overwhelming to create dashboards in Excel. Here're a few good reasons why people switch to Datapad from Excel.

### #1. No Mobile Access

You can't access your dashboard from your mobile. Yes, you can definitely view your dashboard via the XLCubed mobile app, but the flexibility and responsiveness you enjoy in its web application aren't the same elsewhere.

### #2. Hard to Maintain

Excel provides next to no automation. It requires manual effort to import and clean your data, which sometimes might take hours. Plus, manual work increases the possibility of human errors.

In fact, there’s no space for human error because you might just compromise your dashboard's integrity even if you unintentionally fudge a number.

So when your company grows, so does your data, and with a lot of manual data cleaning and validation work, it might not be feasible to use Excel to track KPIs via dashboards.

### #3. No Real-time Access to Data

Excel limits you from accessing your data in real-time. It doesn't update your data automatically, even if it's linked to a data source. Hence, the data you view in the Excel workbook is always outdated.

Again, automation is something that you'll miss if you choose to create a KPI dashboard on Excel. 

### #4. Lacks in Terms of Collaboration

A collaborative KPI dashboard is always better than just a Dashboard. 

What's the difference?

Although a KPI dashboard lets you present data via stunning visualizations, a collaborative dashboard allows you and your team to analyze, monitor, and share feedback simultaneously.

Let's be honest here. You're not near to success if you think of your business as a one-man show. Therefore, keeping your team aligned with the company goals and performance in real-time becomes really important.

### #5. Higher-Learning Curve

Excel is a vast ocean that's tough to be explored in a day. Even with customizations, its chart wizard is pretty complicated for new users. 

You may encounter formatting limitations and end up spending hours customizing charts.

For the most part, customizations in Excel are far away from just drag-and-drop.
