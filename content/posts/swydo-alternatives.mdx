Some of the best Swydo alternatives for quick access to KPIs are Datapad, Mix Panel, GoodData, Amplitude, Metrics Watch, Adverity, Ninja Cat, Whatagraph, Slemma, Spider Strategies, InfoCaptor, and Looker.

In this guide, you will find a full comparison between these Swydo alternatives and know why they are better than Swydo in many aspects.

## Why Might You Look for Swydo Alternatives?

### Reason #1. Weak Customer Support

Any tool, no matter the market segment, needs to have flawless customer support. In most cases, when a customer buys a new tool, they often get stuck in some way using it and need an expert to sort the issues out.

Swydo seems to fail at providing even basic customer service to its customers.

Many people have complained about the long waits and inaccuracy in solving the issues.

Here’s one example:

![swydo g2 review #1 ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/08ikTig5Gc94ikuhcyGmztU4pM.png)

### Reason #2. Problem with Report Generation Feature

Swydo has an option of automating report generation of KPI dashboards so you can save time and send the reports across to your clients or teammates quickly. 

But it sometimes becomes annoying as the dashboarding platform doesn’t allow you to edit the reports after creation.

What’s even worse is there’s no solution for it on any community or Youtube.

Apart from this, Swydo also lacks multiple edit options and doesn’t have a great organizational structure.

![swydo g2 review #2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DmGtMgtnEr9Fgs4Q7sHZ6BYB91k.png)

### Reason #3. Lacks Flexibility

When you invest in any KPI tracking software, you want it to be completely customizable and flexible. 

Why?

That’s because you want your KPI dashboards to suit your brand color and theme.

Apart from the customization flexibility, Swydo also lacks widget option flexibility. 

Meaning that you can't change a certain widget according to what you want to actually display on the dashboard.

Here’s an example of how customers often struggle with Swydo widgets:
