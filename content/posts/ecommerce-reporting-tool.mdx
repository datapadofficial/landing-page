## What is Ecommerce Reporting?

Ecommerce reporting is the process of collecting and analyzing data from an ecommerce business. This data can include sales, customer behavior, website performance, and more. 

The goal of ecommerce reporting is to provide insights into the performance of the business and identify areas for improvement. This data can be used to make informed decisions about marketing, product development, customer service, and more.

Ecommerce reporting can also help you identify areas of opportunity and potential areas of improvement. Additionally, ecommerce reporting can help you track the success of your campaigns and measure the ROI of your investments.

Another way ecommerce reporting can also help you is by providing a snapshot of your store's performance at any given time.

Let‚Äôs now talk a little bit about the use cases of ecommerce reporting tools.

## What are the Use Cases of Ecommerce Reporting Tools?

### #1. Saves Time and Resources

Data collection has become a hectic process with the widespread use of multiple platforms for marketing and other activities. 

**ü§î Think About It:**  Pulling data from different platforms, putting them together into a spreadsheet (manually), and then visualizing them to make them presentable to your team. 

Tiring enough! üò™

Ecommerce reporting tools help you perform the entire data collection process once and for all. You need to set up or integrate your data points with the reporting tool for initials. 

Once it's done, the tool will automatically import data at periodic intervals and present it to you via easy-to-understand visuals.

Imagine the number of hours per employee you can save by automating this process.

### #2. Cost-Effective

An Ecommerce reporting tool is a win-win choice for your company.

You see, the market is highly competitive, and you can get a reporting tool at a price much less than hiring a full-time data analyst.

Besides, AI-driven reporting tools help you perform tasks quickly and error-free. It automatically eliminates repetitive, unnecessary data entry and analysis tasks and gets you straight to the main process of measuring KPIs.

### #3. Easy to Work With

Think of two situations:

**Situation 1:&#x20;**&#x41; spreadsheet with 100+ columns and tons of data categorized by date, name, and value.

**Situation 2:&#x20;**&#x41; neat and clean ecommerce dashboard that shows the exact metric you want via easy-to-understand visuals.

The second situation is what most reporting tools offer. Instead of baking around countless numbers, reporting tools show data via easily customizable dashboards. 

Today, most reporting tools offer a user-friendly interface. However, you always have the flexibility to change the look and feel of your dashboard to your pleasure.

Moreover, you can instantly view the results of any activity, including email campaigns, advertising, and web traffic.

### #4. Offers Real-Time Decision Making

Manual reporting consumes time. And by the time your report is ready, it's already a week late from the day data was collected. 

This time gap often prevents organizations from making confident decisions under time-sensitive situations.

Ecommerce reporting tools help everyone, from your new marketing analyst to your CMO, to stay up to date with what's happening - and fix mistakes before they can hamper your sales.

### #5. Clear and Concise 

A reporting tool presents complex data via stunning data visuals. And thus, from investors to stakeholders, everyone can get an at-a-glance summary of the company's performance.

Basically, you don't need to answer "So.. what's the point of all this?" question again ‚Äì a reporting tool will do that for you.
