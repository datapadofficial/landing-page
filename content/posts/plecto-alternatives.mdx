Some of the best Plecto alternatives we came across in recent years are Datapad, Databox, Geckoboard, DashThis, Domo, ClicData, KPI software by HubSpot, Spider Strategies, ActivTrak, [Klipfolio](https://www.datapad.io/blog/klipfolio-alternatives), and Transpara.

In this article, we will list down the top Plecto alternatives to consider if you’re on a sticky budget but want something better than Plecto.

But before we start!

Let’s give you an overview real quick.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/1EXeCAgt2nE5BwGcMYk4Xf0flk.png)

Before reviewing the above-mentioned [KPI dashboards](https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-dashboard-software), let’s answer the main question - Why do you need a Plecto alternative?

## Reasons Why You Might Need A Plecto Alternative?

### Reason #1. Plecto is Expensive

Let’s talk about Plecto’s pricing for a moment. Plecto has 3 paid plans.

The first is its Medium plan, priced at $250/month. This is for 10 licenses. If we compare this with its competitors, they charge half of this for 10 users (some even less) with more or less the same features.

And its second paid plan is Large for $390 per month for 10 users.

The third plan is Enterprise, for which you will have to contact their sales department.

Our point here is that spending so much on a KPI dashboard tool is only a good decision when you know this will make your business a fortune; otherwise, it's money down the drain.

When prices are so high, people will obviously expect more from the tool, and as a result, Plecto has got many reviews with complaints of high price. Here’s one such from [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/).

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/q4nSIK4QipsX4HmdFxpmsI0TM.png)

### Reason #2. Doesn’t Have Several Customization Features

A KPI dashboard tool without premium customization options is a waste. 

It might sound a bit harsh, but that's the bitter truth. If you want to track KPIs in-depth, you should be able to customize each and every aspect of your dashboard. 

Plecto has some decent customization options like creating charts, filters, etc. but you can’t customize everything. And that’s where the customers aren’t satisfied with the tool.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DJfSEBvtQOpdzscbrngUf7tYF3w.png)

### Reason #3. No Real-Time Google Analytics Integration

So the tool portrays itself as a real-time Google Analytics integration, but that’s not really true. 

The tool isn’t capable of pulling out real-time data from Google Analytics. It takes 30 minutes to an hour for it to refresh. 

This can prove to be a serious issue whose business depends on day-to-day traffic.

Now that you know some prominent reasons for switching from Plecto to other KPI dashboard software, here’s a list of alternatives you can try out.

## 11 Best Plecto Alternatives You Must Try
