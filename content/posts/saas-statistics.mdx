## SaaS Growth and SaaS Trends Statistics

### #1. SaaS End-User Spending Worldwide

![saas end user spending chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ob31eAuP01zvu1NlSzNFQzZQY.png)

[Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/505243/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue/)

The global SaaS market is projected to grow from $102 billion in 2019 to $195 billion in 2023 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.3%. Currently the total value of SaaS is $167.11 billion.

The growth of SaaS users is expected to outpace the growth of the SaaS market itself, with a projected CAGR of 12.7%, reaching nearly 2.2 billion users by 2022. 

This growth will be driven by the increasing adoption of public cloud services across all industry verticals, the emergence of new use cases, and the shift towards subscription-based models. 

### #2. Average Number of SaaS Applications Used by Organizations Worldwide

![average number of saas applications used in company](https://framerusercontent.com/images/OAGP9cY08v3IjdRKBpUwNvBUY.png)

The average number of software as a service (SaaS) applications used by organizations worldwide has increased from [8 in 2015 to 110 in 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1233538/average-number-saas-apps-yearly/) - it has grown even more in 2022.

This growth is largely due to the increasing adoption of SaaS applications for their scalability and cost-effectiveness. 

Additionally, the emergence of cloud-based SaaS has enabled organizations to leverage applications for a variety of use cases, such as collaboration, customer relationship management, customer service, and analytics. 

The increasing popularity of SaaS applications is expected to continue driving their adoption in the future.

### #3. Workload Running Scenario in Upcoming Years

This means that companies will use cloud services to access the computing power instead of running these workloads on in-house servers or hardware. 

This could result in faster, easier access to data and applications and improved scalability for businesses.

Italy, Netherlands, and Belgium are the next three in line that make up the top 5 countries in the European SaaS market.

### #7. Latin America Set to Disrupt the SaaS Market

Latin America has now joined the race to share a significant share of the SaaS market worldwide. 

From 2017 to 2021, the Latin American SaaS market has grown from [$1.48 billion to $4.11 billion](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/x9x858/latin_american). But that's not just it; from 2021 to 2022, the SaaS market of L.A. has grown to $5.31 billion.
