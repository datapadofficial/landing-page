## SaaS Growth and SaaS Trends Statistics

### #1. SaaS End-User Spending Worldwide

![saas end user spending chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ob31eAuP01zvu1NlSzNFQzZQY.png)

[Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/505243/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue/)

The global SaaS market is projected to grow from $102 billion in 2019 to $195 billion in 2023 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.3%. Currently the total value of SaaS is $167.11 billion.

The growth of SaaS users is expected to outpace the growth of the SaaS market itself, with a projected CAGR of 12.7%, reaching nearly 2.2 billion users by 2022. 

This growth will be driven by the increasing adoption of public cloud services across all industry verticals, the emergence of new use cases, and the shift towards subscription-based models. 

### #2. Average Number of SaaS Applications Used by Organizations Worldwide

![average number of saas applications used in company](https://framerusercontent.com/images/OAGP9cY08v3IjdRKBpUwNvBUY.png)

The average number of software as a service (SaaS) applications used by organizations worldwide has increased from [8 in 2015 to 110 in 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1233538/average-number-saas-apps-yearly/) - it has grown even more in 2022.

This growth is largely due to the increasing adoption of SaaS applications for their scalability and cost-effectiveness. 

Additionally, the emergence of cloud-based SaaS has enabled organizations to leverage applications for a variety of use cases, such as collaboration, customer relationship management, customer service, and analytics. 

The increasing popularity of SaaS applications is expected to continue driving their adoption in the future.

### #3. Workload Running Scenario in Upcoming Years

![saas workload running scenario chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/EmV5RNKUqssipNkI3NF7zLhhYi8.png)

[In five years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/01/07/83-of-enterprise-workloads-will-be-in-the-cloud-by-2020/?sh=7f1f76356261), 95% of all workloads (i.e., tasks, processes, or activities that require computing power) will be run on cloud computing services and platforms. 

This means that companies will use cloud services to access the computing power instead of running these workloads on in-house servers or hardware. 

This could result in faster, easier access to data and applications and improved scalability for businesses.

### #4. How SaaS Companies Funded Their Growth In 2022?

Italy, Netherlands, and Belgium are the next three in line that make up the top 5 countries in the European SaaS market.

### #7. Latin America Set to Disrupt the SaaS Market

![how likey saas comapanies increase pricing in 2023](https://framerusercontent.com/images/oBH6adsjlhshp5boyinYMmjwwaI.png)

### #24. Most Effective Content Marketing Channel

LinkedIn alone generates 3x more conversions than Twitter and Facebook together for B2B SaaS companies.

But we are not saying emails are outdated. It typically depends on the company's individual marketing strategies. You see, 57% of companies still use email signup options for newsletters.

## SaaS Challenges Statistics

Security breach can be lethal for your business. ☠

Over [80% of enterprises](https://www.lucatagliaferro.com/post/saas-statistics/) have reported that their employees store clients' sensitive information on third-party cloud services without permission.

![saas staff training ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/hrUyJiYxGEulVj8mSbm2b2rw68.png)

Despite the overwhelming demand for SaaS tools in coming years, most IT organizations still need to be more confident going SaaS.

Moreover, most SaaS organizations consider team offboarding as a tedious task within SaaS tools. It can even take up to 7 hours to offboard a single user.
