## What is a Dashboarding Tool?

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/H30N8U72K6ClEQdQTExJ2FgP5c.gif)

A dashboarding tool is a simplified data-management software that collects, monitors, and displays complex data via interactive and customizable dashboards and reports.

In simpler terms, dashboarding tools help you monitor and visualize your business health and accompany you with data-driven insights.

Now the question you might have is whether your business really needs a centralized dashboarding tool. ü§î

We would‚Äôve said NO üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è if it had been the 1990s, but as of today, every enterprise, despite the size, is surfing around tons of data - some are visible while most remain hidden.

And so, to easily squeeze, analyze, and monitor data from every place, dashboarding tools are a perfect solution. 

Apart from saving your resources, these tools are a great help when it comes to KPI measurements. They hold the capability to present the worst form of data in an easy-to-understand format.

Thereby helping the c-suites make timely and better data-driven decisions. 

If you don't want to read whole article, you can watch the video below to find out about the best free dashboard softwares.
