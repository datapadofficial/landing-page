Some of the best Redash alternatives for  creating beatiful dashboards are Datapad, Metabase, Tableau, Looker, Trevor, Microsoft Power BI, Plotly, and Mode.

In this guide, you will find a full comparison between the above-mentioned Redash alternatives and know which one is the best for your business.

## 3 Reasons Why You Might Need a Redash Alternative?

### Reason #1. SQL Knowledge Is a Must to Use Redash

Unlike other KPI dashboarding and reporting tools, to use Redash, you must know SQL. Without its knowledge, you can track KPIs but can't generate reports.

![redash review](https://framerusercontent.com/images/03WbTdxNuQUeGSKbZ1MZd6JGK3Y.png)

There’s a way where you can auto-generate and auto-refresh your reports later, but to create your first KPI report, SQL is the only option you’ve got.

### Reason #2. The Tool Isn’t Meant for Large Companies

If you're a company looking to scale your KPI tracking or an agency that tracks KPIs for multiple clients, Redash might just not be the right software for you.

The tool simply doesn't have features that might help you scale the KPI operations of your business.

It’s great for internal use, but you can leverage it to view presentations to your investors, send reports to clients, or bring many team members onboard.

![redash review #2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Xq6VYBqsGuc4zM2eeAmok8dgE.png)

### Reason #3. Lacks Integration with Multiple Data Sources

The platform has limited integrations, so you can't pull out data from multiple data sources. This is another reason why Redash isn't a scalable option and is not meant for large companies.

## #1. [Datapad](https://www.datapad.io/)

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png)

[Datapad](https://www.datapad.io/) helps you track all essential [metrics ](https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics)from stunning dashboards.

The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use. With our tool, anyone in your team with zero technical knowledge can start building reports in mere seconds.

### Key Feature #1. Templates

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/m7rLbpP0wFAeaQMSOB7G5u9Kuis.png)

Creating reports for your business is no easy task. You have to determine a lot, from which metrics to choose to design the right charts.

If you are an agency and want to create the same reports for multiple clients, then this hassle becomes even more burdensome.

Guess what? Datapad lets you do all this with just a few clicks.

With Datapad's templating features, you can:

- Choose from a gallery of pre-designed templates and apply them with 1-click
- Build a custom dashboard and re-use it as a template by changing it's sources
- Share all connected data sources in the workspace with your teammates

### ‍Key Feature #2. Team Collaboration

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/lfMtGJd62Mic0PYHmbTCMfmPDNY.png)

Tracking KPIs isn't a one-person job when you have a lot of them; you need a team. But not all KPI dashboard tools let you bring your team on board. 

Guess what? Datapad lets you do it quickly and easily. 

Moreover, you can assign individual team members tasks to handle, goals to achieve, and metrics to measure.

With Datapad's team collaboration feature, you can:

- Get notified whenever there’s an update for any metrics and KPIs you track
- Communicate around your metrics and KPIs with your team members
- Get push notifications on your phone to stay updated with all your KPIs

### Key Feature #3. Automated Reports & Scorecards

Wouldn't it be great if you could check your business KPIs first thing in the morning, straight from your inbox?

With our [dashboard software](https://www.datapad.io/blog/dashboard-software-for-small-business), you can subscribe to any dashboard and receive daily email updates.

All you have to do is build a dashboard, click the subscribe button, and set your email preferences.

The best part is you can share reports with anyone, even emails outside of your organization or workspace.

#### Step 1: Subscribe to a dashboard

#### Step 2: Check your inbox

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/iTtKlXCFWIhxL9GYHa6e0cqiEek.png)

With Datapad’s report and scorecard automation, you can:

- Subscribe to any dashboard
- Receive daily highlights around all KPIs
- Send reports to users in and outside of your organization
- Customize the date range, calculation, and styling of KPIs

### Pricing

Datapad has a free tier that includes 1 dashboard. If you want more, you can upgrade to the $30 Standard Plan, which includes 3 dashboards and scales with your usage. Datapad also offers a Business Plan tailored for agencies and includes dedicated customer support.

We are now offering an earlybird discount to all users, so it's a great time to [sign up and give Datapad a spin](https://app.datapad.io/).

### How Does Datapad Compare to Redash?

Redash is a great dashboard creation tool, but it's more for tech people who are aware of how SQL works.

That’s because you might need SQL when importing data, adding it to dashboards, and studying your KPIs.

Although you can create dashboards via drag-and-drop builder and save templates, the option’s not scalable because it simply isn’t meant for it.

On the other hand, Datapad is mobile-friendly that needs no coding or technical knowledge to track KPIs. In fact, you can just tap on elements and create a dashboard in minutes.

So all-in-all, Redash is meant for users who have the technical knowledge and depend a lot on KPIs, and Datapad is for users and businesses who just want an overview of KPI performance but quickly.

You can get the best of both tools by using Redash to drill down on data and Datapad to manage your team.

### 2 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Use Datapad?

#### #1. You Don’t Want An In-Depth Analysis But Just Have a Quick Overview of Your Data

Datapad isn't meant for in-depth KPI tracking. The motive of building this tool is to save founders and businesses time. What you get with it is a quick overview of all the KPIs, and you can then guide your team via the app about how to tackle specific KPI outbursts.

#### #2. You Need a Lot of Integrations

Our app integrates with major data sources (MySQL, Google Analytics, Facebooks Ads, etc), but for now, we've kept the integrations limited.

We are coming up with more and more integrations soon, but now if you want to create 10 dashboards from 100 different data sources, create them with Redash and not Datapad.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros

✅ Lets your track KPIs from your mobile phones

✅ Bring your team onboard quickly

✅ Assign each team member a KPI and set individual goals

✅ Search KPIs and get their overview quickly

#### Cons

❌ Lacks some integrations to import data (coming soon)
