## What is a Dashboard Reporting Software?

Dashboard reporting tools are solutions that allow you to monitor, analyze, visualize, and interact with data over a unified platform.

In general terms, these tools help you convert raw data into knowledgeable insights. They do so by extracting meaningful data from databases and presenting them in charts, graphs, or other visualization formats.

**Food For Thought:** Dashboard reporting tools empower businesses with data-driven decision-making and business intelligence capabilities. Let's get this through a quick example.

Suppose you’re working on a marketing campaign that has several aspects being measured and analyzed. You spend hours accumulating tons of data from your marketing campaign, but at a glance, they are just numbers ranging from zero to infinity.

Neither these numbers are anywhere near to be called insights, nor do they attract your stakeholders or team leads.😞

Now, because everyone misunderstands the data, it becomes pretty useless (although it has every story to tell about your campaign's performance).

Here's when the dashboard reporting tool saves your efforts!

The tool helps you create stunning visualization of your business key performance indicators (KPIs). Thereby transforming messy data into easy-to-understand insights for anyone from non-technical employees to stakeholders.

While this is one of the primary advantages, dashboard reporting tools have many more things to offer.

## What are the Benefits of Using a Dashboard Reporting Tool? 

### #1. Make Your Data Tell Stories

Believe it or not, dashboard software can let your data speak for itself. They can transform data into stunning visuals and derive a complete story that gets you every small business-related statistical detail.📊

### #2. Saves Time and Resources

Evidently, the tool can be a great time-saver for hustling geniuses. It can help you automate the entire process, from data extraction to visualization, all with a single click.

Plus, as it automates everything, you don't need your employee to spend hours working on the process.

### #3. Data-Driven Decision Making

Now that you have a data-driven story and ample time in hand. You are more sure of making decisions by analyzing what's working for you, the KPI trends, and the wrong-doings.

With a knowledgeable database served in front of you, you can easily take suggestions from your team and stakeholders for future campaigns and business strategies.
