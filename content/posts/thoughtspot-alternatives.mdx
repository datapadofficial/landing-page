ThoughtSpot is a software that helps you get answers to data-related questions with a business-friendly analytics experience that delivers AI-powered insights at the speed of thought.

People like ThoughtSpot because it's made for modern teams with a focus on fast, actionable insights for all.

However, when you need a tool with a comparatively smaller learning curve and something affordable, ThoughtSpot falls short.

In this article, I will tell you why you should try an alternative to ThoughtSpot and discuss the best ones in the market.

## Why Do You Need a ThoughtSpot Alternative?

There are three main reasons why users switch from ThoughtSpot to one of its competitors:

- ThoughtSpot has a significant learning curve.

- It has poor UI/UX design that makes it hard to navigate.

- It lacks customization options.

### Reason 1: Significant Learning Curve

ThoughtSpot is less intuitive for users unfamiliar with business intelligence tools.

Oftentimes you'd need to configure many attributes in the backend to get things done or put the right fields in the right places.

Despite being AI-powered, ThoughtSpot requires some technical knowledge and analytical skills to harness its fullest potential.

For instance, building your query with words for more complicated questions can sometimes over-simplify or pull in the wrong parameters.

### Reason 2: Poor UI/UX Design Makes It Hard to Navigate

ThoughtSpot fails to deliver a top-notch user experience. Many reviews highlighted the challenges faced when working with data on the platform. 

For instance, if you want to add a new column to a table, you have to edit the database connection completely rather than just the table. 

Similarly, charts and visuals lack interactivity. You can’t zoom in and out of charts to get more or less granular insights.

### Reason 3: Lacks Customization Options

ThoughtSpot doesn't give you free-hands for customizing specific visuals or the dashboard in its entirety. You'd find it challenging to customize legend values or overlay your brand colors over the dashboard, something that ThoughtSpot alternatives like Domo does perfectly.
