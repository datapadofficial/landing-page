Some of the best Databox alternatives we've tested this year are Datapad, Google Data Studio, GoodData, DashThis, Geckoboard, NinjaCat, Swydo, AgencyAnalytics, and Cyfe.

In this article, you will discover the top Databox alternatives that will help you create dashboards and [track KPIs](https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-track-kpis) better.

But before we start!

Here’s a tl;dr to save your time.

![databox alternatives comparision chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/1q4igCdPTUXSsk2petCClKGQopQ.png)

But before we deep-dive into the above-mentioned tools, let us tell you three primary reasons why you should look for a Databox alternative.

## Why Might You Look for a Databox Alternative?

### Reason #1. Poor Customer Support

For any SaaS platform, customer support is one of the best ways to retain clients. 

If you help your customers when they need you the most, your customer retention rate could be through the roof, but, at the same time, if you fail to put your customers’ needs before yours, your business will crumble.

[According to HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-stats), 90% of customers in America use customer service as a factor when deciding to spend on a product/service. 

Databox doesn’t have a great customer service department. The users are quite angry with the time Databox’s customer reps take to reply to them.

Here’s one such example:

![G2 Databox negative customer review](https://framerusercontent.com/images/hDxSH89PjLKQk8QpUEQJWGB9DU.png)

### Reason #2. Problematic Date Range Feature

When we tested out [Databox](https://www.datapad.io/blog/databox-pricing), we found out that the platform lacks the date range selection feature, meaning you can’t select a specific date range and track KPIs.

Let us explain to you what we mean by that.

Suppose you're tracking a KPI - retention rate, and you want to know the retention rate from 3rd February to 10rd May 2022. 

Databox simply doesn’t let you filter data that way. The only options you get to filter data are - daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Date range feature is essential for tracking as you might need to know your growth in a specific time period.

### Reason #3. Lacks Complex Report Creation 

With Databox, you can create a simple dashboard for data analysis, but when you have complex and long data, it fails to convert them into a dashboard.

Also, sometimes its data sources cannot connect your historical data to the platform, which might lead to data loss. This can be a major issue, as you could lose thousands of dollars worth of data in seconds.

Now that you know why you might need to switch from Databox to some other KPIs tracking dashboard software, it’s time to see your potential options.

## 9 Best Databox Alternatives to Try Out in 2024
