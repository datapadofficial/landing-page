Did you know that about [1.1 billion people](https://www.microbizmag.co.uk/microsoft-excel-statistics/) worldwide use Microsoft Excel? ü§Ø

No matter how old Excel gets, people still stick to excel dashboards and use templates.

Some people use it for data entry, some for bookkeeping, and some for creating dashboards.

We wanted people to know how they can create Excel dashboards and keep an eye on business KPIs, so we did it.

In this article, we have brought to you a tutorial on creating an Excel dashboard and some of the drawbacks you should know about.

**But before we start, here‚Äôs the TL;DR:** 

- An Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of KPIs and metrics using easy-to-understand data visualization elements.

- Dashboard creation in Excel is a manual-intensive process, which makes it time consuming.

- To get started you need to build a dataset; you can do this by importing data on Excel or entering it manually.

- You then need to prepare your data by refining it and removing duplicate entries - Excel will let you do it automatically.

- Insert charts you want on your dashboard for the data you have with you.

- Finally create your Excel dashboard and use several customization options to give it a personal touch.

- Although you can create dashboards on Excel, it‚Äôs not an ideal choice. The platform offers less to no automation, it doesn‚Äôt show you data in real-time, and it‚Äôs tough to onboard your team.

- You can try Datapad - a mobile friendly dashboard software instead. It lets you automate most of your dashboard creation process, thus saving you time.

## What is an Excel Dashboard? 

An Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of KPIs and metrics using easy-to-understand data visualization elements.

These elements generally constitute graphs, pie charts, cohorts, tables, and interactive widgets.  

In simple words, Excel dashboards are visual representations of large data tracks. It can help you create Static and Dynamic dashboards.

The only hindrance is, you should know how to use Excel to the fullest! Or else, this is how you will find yourself with Excel:

![computer with a lot of charts](https://framerusercontent.com/images/RdhwGwu9xEheEakIYq3zMblpWkY.gif)

Below we have curated a step-by-step guide on creating a full-fledged dashboard on Excel. 

**Disclaimer:**  Although creating dashboards in Excel involves a heavy amount of manual work, it's worth the effort.

So, take a chill- üíä, be patient üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and let's go.

## How to Create a Dashboard in Excel? 

Here‚Äôs a 5-step Excel dashboard tutorial you need to create dashboards in Excel as fast as possible.

### Step 1: Build Your Database

Like there's no Hogwarts without Hagrid, there's no Dashboard without Data.

![Hagrid applause](https://framerusercontent.com/images/kQk8TBD9w16Ygjc9FkbSIVRN8c.gif)

So firstly, we'll see how to import data to Excel.

Excel has a limited number of options to assist the data import process. But hopefully, you will find your preferred option among the few.

**Note:**  If you have a well-organized dataset on another Excel sheet, you can simply copy and paste it. 

However, if you are just getting started with the data collection process, here's how and where to begin.

Click on **Data** and choose.

![excel click on data tab](https://framerusercontent.com/images/5GEasK0hi7LPP9FqVf9xHHCEw.png)

Here, Excel offers your four options to import data:

- **From File:&#x20;**&#x49;mport data from your PC

- **From Database:&#x20;**&#x49;mport data from SQL servers, Microsoft, etc.  

- **From Text:**  Import data from text or CSV files

- **From Other Sources:**  Import data from other sources such as SQL server tables, SQL server analysis cubes, or XML files

![excel import data](https://framerusercontent.com/images/xFPCrRck95NG41B58vTwxKNyJss.gif)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Database for Action

The dataset you import is called Raw Data. 

That's because the database is filled with extra columns, irregular decimal points, and raw numbers, which you ideally don't want on your dashboard.

You see, you only want that part of your database which you need to visualize on your dashboard ‚Äì the heavy numbers, of course.

For example, we imported a short dataset from our Monthly Sales Report.

![database sample](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Z4WYVvHWJ67GWAnh20ZRBLExo0.png)

**Tell Us:**  Among the Excel columns from A to E, which one would you prefer not to add to your dashboard? 

To extract meaningful data, create another sub-sheet as **Chart Tab** and copy-paste the dataset from columns into it. 

So now you have the dataset you want to visualize. Now let's start preparing this dataset for action.

Excel comes with several in-built tools to ease your data cleansing process. Click on **Data**, and you'll have the following options available.

![excel data format options ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/2TslPf7ywyFy67dTcxKnlRbEFM.png)

- **Alignment:**  Organize data in ascending or descending order

- **Data Filtering:**  Add an advanced filtering widget to each column

- **Custom Sorting:**  Sort data by column, value, color, font color, and order

- **Remove Duplicates:**  Removes any duplicate data

Furthermore, use Excel formulas to simplify the raw database as much as possible.

Lastly, double-check the dataset for any typos or errors.

### Step 3: Custom Format Your Charts for Your Preference

Once your dataset is cleaned and prepared for data analysis, it's time to add some visualizations.

For instance, If you want to visualize the Total Product Sold each month, you need an Excel chart, right?. 

Here's how you can make one.

Select the dataset you want to visualize. Then, go to the **Insert tab** in the top menu bar and choose from Excel's in-built visualization gallery.

![choose a chart type](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jFzGJZHiCy9MSzQUNgIqVwgiVrg.png)

Suppose you opted for a bar graph to present the dataset. Here's how it will be presented.

![total products sold bar chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/T6fvDAw5kCRQqvEh0jQ2At1e1I.png)

Likewise, if you want to use a different type of visualization to present another dataset, let's say, Return Rate. 

Follow the same steps; select th&#x65;**&#x20;Month** and **Return Rate** columns > Click o&#x6E;**&#x20;Insert** > Choose **Pie Chart** from the visual element gallery. And voila!

![Return rate pie chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Uqy2D3pU4McvP9enhkwyILJ1g.png)

Want to use a different type of dynamic chart?

Excel has tons of them, namely:

- **Column Chart or Bar Chart:**  Visually compare value across a few categories

- **Area and Line Chart:**  Show trends over time (years, months, or days) or categories

- **Pir or Doughnut Chart:**  Show the proportion of a whole (generally used for data available in %)

- **Hierarchy Chart:**  Compare parts to a whole or several columns of categories form a hierarchy

- **Static Chart:**  Show statistical analysis of your data

- **Pivot Table:&#x20;**&#x54;o summarize selected columns

![creating chart for purschases made](https://framerusercontent.com/images/A6a0VUnAGMjJDyOM3bVIyhSzAYc.gif)

### Step 4: Create an Excel Dashboard

In the previous step, you learned to visualize data in different forms and figures.

However, keeping data and its visualization on the same sheet can be daunting later on. ‚ò†

So to build a full-fledged Excel dashboard, create a sub sheet named **Dashboard**, and move all your data visualization to this sub sheet. 

You and your team can use this sheet as the main dashboard. Doing this will also help you to:

- Display multiple data visualizations under one sheet

- Control who can access/view/edit the raw data sheet

- Automatically change graph data by making changes in raw data sheet

![four excel dashboards](https://framerusercontent.com/images/AnlNSy1FZttdgw1CGCI7MdCR0.png)

### Step 5: Customize Your Dashboard

And now to the final step ‚Äì Customizations. 

To start with customizations,**&#x20;Double-click** on the chart you want to customize.

A drop-down menu appears on the right sidebar of your screen with the following options.

![customization options for charts](https://framerusercontent.com/images/q3beIXHqVapC0ZldQLZ08N1nPfc.png)

Use it to customize your chart title, data labels, colors, and data table via chart formatting options.

**Note:&#x20;**&#x59;ou can also use conditional formatting for advanced customization options.

And that's it! Achievement unlocked! üèÜ

You've created your first interactive Excel dashboard. üéâ   

But as we said earlier, creating an Excel dashboard is a manual process, let‚Äôs understand what drawbacks you might face when tracking KPIs (key performance indicators) on Excel.

## Drawbacks of Creating Dashboard with Excel

![limitations of using dashboards in excel ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/0qhA9XaZ4U44bQGkvtj8Cgwx4k.png)

### #1. Very Limited Automation

Have you seen an Excel dashboard before? ü§î

It's so clean and organized, with data on one sub-sheet and visuals on the other. And you probably think doing this is an easy task, just copy and paste, isn't it?

But very few know that creating this Excel dashboard took hours of manual work, hundreds of left and right clicks, and concentration hard enough to suffer eye pains and migraines. üß†

It probably takes hours because Excel provides next to no automation.

Although at the initial stages of data extraction and cleaning, Excel has some features to remove duplicate data. But again, you're advised to double-check the dataset for errors.

### #2. No Real-Time Access to Data

For those unaware, in Excel, there's nothing like real-time. ‚åõ 

Unless you're a developer who can connect Excel to a database and code all of the scripts and macros that automatically refresh your data, the data in your Excel spreadsheet will not be in real-time.

And this is a major drawback if we bridge it to creating dashboards in Excel.

You see, what's the purpose of a full-fledged dashboard if the data you're viewing is outdated?

Yet again, you need to suffer through manual processes to update the data repeatedly. And that‚Äôs easy, if you work like this üëáüèª

![man typing very fast](https://framerusercontent.com/images/yJekCEhpYPhuFXRqLLFygA0NKE.gif)

### #3. Lacks Customization Options

We compared Excel to other dashboard creation tools, and guess what? Excel needs to catch up on providing out-of-the-box customization options to users.

Yes, it does have customization options. But that's been the same way since 2006. 

Moreover, the type of data visualization elements provided by Excel are rigid and limited. 

### #4. Hard to Onboard Your Whole Team

Let's be real, you ain‚Äôt running a six-figure business without a team.

And that makes team collaboration a vital feature of any dashboard. But Excel simply doesn't foster collaboration.

**Think about it:**  If you're using Excel as your main data dashboard and are sharing it with your team, it's challenging to manage the version of the Excel spreadsheet that everyone is seeing. This makes it more difficult to collaborate around the data because stakeholders may be looking at different reports.

Everything results in endless duplication of efforts, lots of unintentional manipulations, and a mess across departments.

### #5. Bad Mobile Experience

This could be a bitter problem for gen z entrepreneurs who manage their businesses using their mobile phones.

Excel isn't mobile-friendly at all. üìµ

Even if you manage to view your Excel dashboard using the XLCubed mobile app, the flexibility and responsiveness you enjoy in its web application aren't the same elsewhere.

Next, let‚Äôs go through some dashboard examples.

## 5 Free Excel Dashboard Templates

The dashboard template we are discussing here focuses on rather granular metrics showcasing a company's core financial status. üí∞

It uses comparative analysis to measure actual and forecasted financial results.
