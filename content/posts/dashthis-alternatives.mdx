‍

We will get into the nitty-gritty details of these software in some time. But first, let's understand - why you might need a DashThis alternative in the first place?

## Why You Might Need a DashThis Alternative?

### Reason #1. Poor User Interface

When tracking KPIs for your business, having an excellent CX will keep you interested and ease your work. 

If a dashboard is poorly designed, has a shabby layout, and lacks finesse, tracking and analyzing data can be a nightmare for you.

Did you know that almost [90% of users](https://truelist.co/blog/ux-statistics/) don't use the software or revisit a site that has a poor user interface? This is a major concern, and DashThis has failed to act on it.

DashThis is a decade-old company but has failed to bring forth a modernized product that business owners love.

Look at the ‘Cons’ section here:

![G2 negative Dashthis review -1 ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JbcSe0d5JDDt2gsiiAUXMCgZs.png)

This is just the tip of the iceberg; if you skim through DashThis's review on Capterra, G2, and other such sites, you will find many people complaining about visualization.

### Reason #2. Limited Customization Options

Let's face it; when you invest in a product (especially in dashboard software), the first thing you see is if you can customize the platform according to your business needs. This is non-negotiable for many managers and company owners.

Customization and personalization go hand in hand, and people love it. So much so that [80% of customers](https://startupbonsai.com/personalization-statistics/) are more likely to buy from a brand that gives them a tailored experience.

DashThis has customization features, but they're basic. Apart from this, the platform also lacks some automation features. 

For example, you can’t get automated alerts on your emails when a KPI you’re tracking falls or rises out of your set benchmark. Everyone expects this basic automation when they pay for a tool monthly, right?

### Reason #3. Steep Learning Curve

Most business owners and managers don't want a tool that's too complex for them to understand, let alone use on a daily basis. 

Here's the catch, to use DashThis, you first have to sit and learn its intricacies, which means spending hours sorting things out.

Good luck with that :) 

And then, when you've finally mastered it, it might be too late for a specific KPI to track.

Now that you know why you must consider a DashThis alternative, it's time to see your potential options.
