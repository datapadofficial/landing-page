KPI reports are a compilation of all crucial KPIs that your company tracks. It could help inventors, team members, and business leaders make calculated decisions based on the same.

So let’s dive straight into the guide.

## What is a KPI Report?

A KPI report is a performance measurement tool that allows you to track, measure, and analyze crucial business KPIs and gauge the overall business performance with respect to set goals.

A typical KPI report consists of several data visualization elements such as graphs, charts, tables, and more to present complex data in an easy-to-read format. However, as said, modern-day KPI reports are dynamic in nature and surface an interactive interface. 

This means you can easily reorganize elements to display information in a way that is pleasant to the eyes. In addition, you can instantly access your report from anywhere around the world.

## What Are the Benefits of KPI Reports?

![benefits of kpi reports](https://framerusercontent.com/images/xFtd2u789PqGjsKyP5fVQFH78y0.png)

### Benefit #1. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses

Not surprisingly, KPI reports are built to present data in an easy-to-understand format. This, in turn, helps managers and business owners easily identify trends over time.

They get a crystal-clear idea of what strategies or loopholes can make or break their business. Moreover, managers can use this information to grasp hidden opportunities within their business strategies.

In a similar way, with the help of KPI reports, leaders can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the organization based on factual, reliable data instead of guesswork.

For example, if the KPI reports show that a particular business strategy yields better results for the organization, leaders can repurpose or duplicate such strategies for multiple departments.

### Benefit #2. Bridge the Learning Gaps

These reports (especially employee KPI reports) analyze employee performance over time. Thereby allowing you to better understand your workforce's capabilities and downsides.

Moreover, making KPI data available to employees can positively direct their behavior. You see, when they know what they are up to and what's expected from them, they tend to adjust their performance toward the measurement.

### Benefit #3. Incentivize Performance

Data doesn't lie, and no matter how debatable a topic is, if it has data to prove itself, you can't simply disagree. 

The same goes for in-house teams and departments. You can't blame someone for being less productive without proving it, and without knowing their efforts, you can't give them a selfless raise.

A KPI report demonstrates employees' performance towards set goals. Adding incentives to these KPIs is a proven way to improve employees performance, boost morale, and drive record-breaking results.

## KPI Reports vs. Metric Reports: What Are the Differences?

Although they sound alike, KPI and metric reports are two completely different aspects of measuring your business performance.

A metric is made up of raw data, while a KPI is made up of several metrics. 

Hence, metrics reports are used by companies to understand their KPIs, which in turn helps them discover if they're going to meet their goals within the set time frame or not.

Generally, professionals gather crucial business metrics into one comprehensive report, which different departments then use as a reference document to find information about organizational goals.

KPI reports, on the other hand, are laser-focused and tied to specific goals and objectives. Unlike metric reports, which provide a granular view of your business performance, KPI reports revolve around high-level metrics that directly impact your organizational goals.

![flow of creating a kpi report](https://framerusercontent.com/images/vMitchM2ByfoJNd44qmBdnRaKY.png)

### Step #1. Understand the Purpose of the Report

Before getting started with report creation, make sure you're clear on one question: What's your intention behind creating the KPI report?

Every business, regardless of size or industry, has predetermined goals and objectives. And to understand which KPIs fit best with your business model, you must have a chat with key stakeholders and decision-makers to discuss your business aims, strategic goals, and objectives.

Whatever it is, ensure that your report comprises three things:

- A long-term goal

- Measurable results

- Achievable Milestones

Doing this will lay down the foundation of your KPI report. In addition, you'll better understand where to aim your efforts and what metrics or KPIs can help you measure success toward your goals.

### Step #2. Pick the Right Set of KPIs

Once you've set your goals right, it's time to choose the KPIs that will gauge your performance.

Fortunately, there's a treasure trove of KPIs pertaining to your business needs. Whether it's for finance, marketing, customer service, or employee satisfaction – you can measure everything relevant to your business.

It's up to you what KPIs you find helpful in measuring business success. However, ensure that your chosen KPIs align with your long-term business goals.

### Step #3. Create a Live Dashboard Report With Datapad

After you have your KPIs ready, it's time to create your first KPI report.

To get started, download our free KPI reporting tool on your mobile device (available for Android and iOS users). 

Or, simply scan this QR code👇🏻to download our app.

Once you're in the app, signup with your email address, mostly it takes a few seconds to confirm your email (necessary to prevent bots from creating reports).

While we check your email ID's authenticity, you'll be prompted to create a workspace on the Datapad app.

For those unaware, a workspace is an area where you can perform all your activities, build reports, and collaborate with your team.

You just need to enter a name to your workspace, let's say," *Max’s KPI Report*."

‍

![create new workspace](https://framerusercontent.com/images/30cyikRk95LI17yRaTE4Cf3Ywd8.jpeg)

‍

Then, click on **Create a dashboard**.

![create your first kpi dashboard](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ROggj4n3h3ySyXQT9ASbdUUv6c.gif)

### Step #4. Integrate All Your Data Points

Now that your dashboard is ready, you need to integrate it with the required data sources to inflow data into the dashboard.

Fortunately, with Datapad, you can import data both ways: Manually and Automatically.

![choose your data source](https://framerusercontent.com/images/KMnYlR2VDZAMGabt4hd2cCcxE.png)

To add KPIs manually, tap on **'Enter Manually.'** Then, add a value, set comparative standards, and choose the type of graph you want your KPI to have - A bar graph, Pie chart, Line diagram, or a simple table.

![add metrics datapad](https://framerusercontent.com/images/1bfQMWCtcyAK2dDm9VxVlgtQB4Y.gif)

### Step #5. Add Visualizations

Now you have enough data on your report ready to be visualized. Choose from our gallery of data visualization elements, such as bar graphs, pie charts, tables, and more, to transform your data into beautiful easy-to-understand visuals.

Furthermore, use our drag-and-drop editor to try out multiple visual elements on a single metric. Once you are satisfied with the visuals, perform further customizations such as changing texts, formatting fonts, colors, and more to make your report soothing to the eyes.

And that's it! Your first-ever KPI report is ready to be reviewed by stakeholders and decision-makers.

However, there are a few things that you must avoid when setting up your KPI reports.

## 5 Things to Avoid When Setting Up Your KPI Reports

- **❌ Don't over complicate your goals: **Keeping it simple is the best way to achieve extraordinary things. As said earlier, decide on your goals and stick to them. Avoid adding new goals or improvising the set goals just to sound ambitious

- **❌ Don't add too much to your reports: **It's easy to get overwhelmed by the number of data sources available. But you can leave out some KPIs that you feel are irrelevant. The best idea is to focus on a small number of KPIs that align with your business objectives. 

- **❌Don't choose a tool with a higher-learning curve: **If you're using a reporting tool, make sure it's easy to use by you and your team. Some features like drag-and-drop customizations, no-code KPI reporting, and more allow anyone to track and monitor KPIs easily.

- **❌ Don't leave your reports unchanged with time: **Since the market is highly dynamic, you can't just create and forget about the KPI report. You must iterate or tweak your reporting KPIs or business strategies on a regular basis for accurate results and impactful decision-making.

- ❌**Don't do it alone:** And lastly, don't try being a one-man army. The proudy it sounds, the lamer it is. Since KPI reports play a significant role in making strategies and decisions, they should always be made in a collaborative environment. 

Creating KPI reports isn’t a tough job. All you need to do is download Datapad, bring your team onboard, and create KPI dashboards that serve as reports to all the decision-makers in your company.
