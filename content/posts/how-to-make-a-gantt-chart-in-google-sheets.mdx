'Gantt Chart' – the name itself sounds overwhelming, no?

Even if you ask the 2 Billion Google sheets users on how do you make a Gantt chart on Google sheets?

Most of them would go like:

_\[Yeah the GIF is buffering, nothing wrong with your device&#x20;_&#xD83D;&#xDE09;_]_

Gantt charts aren’t everyone’s piece of cake, yet they are no rocket science.

In this article, we’ll walk you through a step-by-step tutorial on how to make a Gantt chart on Google sheets. Time to face the music. 🎶

**But before we get into it, here’s a TL;DR you might want to see:** 

- Creating a Gantt chart in Google sheets is a 6-step process, you first need to prepare your database, calculate task duration, create a stacked bar graph, customize the graph to make it a Gantt chart, customize for personalization, and then add dependencies if needed.

- Later in the article you will find 5 Gantt chart templates that you can make a copy of and use.

- Making Gantt charts in Google Sheets isn’t everyone’s cup of tea; it takes a lot of time, isn’t mobile-friendly, team onboarding can be tough, and has some more drawbacks.

- Try our tool - Datapad, a mobile-friendly software to create Gantt charts or any other kind of charts and dashboard that takes care of all the drawbacks you face when creating Gantt charts on GSheets.

## How to Create a Gantt Chart in Google Sheets?

### Step #1. Input Data

Open a blank Google spreadsheet and make three columns, namely:

- **Task Heading:**  Includes each task name

- **Start Date:**  When did the task begin?

- **End Date:&#x20;**&#x57;hen did the task end?

As a sample dataset, we have created a table with ten tasks and their start and end date.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/hCIiSudxlcng2WV7GlCANTkb5Y.png)

Now to create a Gantt chart, you need to calculate time durations for every task.

Had a hard time with Maths? 🤔

No worries, we've got the formulas ready for you.

### Step #2. Calculate Task Duration

Create a second table with three columns:

- **A:&#x20;**&#x54;ask Heading

- **B:&#x20;**&#x53;tart Date

- **C:**  Time duration

The first two columns are similar to the above table. So simply copy-paste the values of both columns in the second table.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/7eQVOKXz6RtAPvrskea3LZpDiY.png)

Next, you need to figure out the start day for each task so that the bars accurately display the start date and task duration.

To do so, use the Google spreadsheet formula: **=int(B2)-int($B$2)**

**Note:**  This formula translates into 👉🏻 Current Task's Start Date – The First Task's Start Date

In our formula, B2 represents the first value in the original 'start date' column. You can change this variable if your table positioning is different.

Insert the formula in the second table's first cell of the start date column (B15 in our case). And then press **Enter**.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/7uspt4yoAz3xjyLezSOQWnw9U.png)

Let's be real; the first/earliest task will obviously start on day 0. And so did our formula.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ggmp8RTV3JHHc9G90f47xwTg.png)

Now click and drag the blue box in the same column until you reach the last task heading.

The sheet converts the timestamp to an integer for the number of days in the date range. Like it did for our dataset.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Zz16M1cBPK6l4QTnBqwTTH9S2Ns.png)

Now, to calculate each task's duration, copy-paste the below formula into the first cell of the Task Duration column (C15).

**= (INT(C2)-INT($B$2))-(INT(B2)-INT($B$2))**

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/poEhC63cR02hf4KDlwsp5LplY0.png)

In the task duration column, Sheets calculate the number of days to completion of each task.

Like in our dataset, the first task requires two days to finish. Similarly, copy and paste the formula down to the last task in the same column.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/2RrkBVrbxdleCR97tl21Jl25U.png)

Again, if you have a different table alignment, the cell numbers in the formula will change accordingly.

### Step #3. Create a Stacked Bar Graph

Highlight all the cells in the second table, then click **Insert** >**&#x20;Chart**

Google sheets automatically present you with a stacked bar graph. Side by side, it also opens up the Chart Editor on the right sidebar.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/t4CNhQtAOdXTDPKwHLisLZNdi4.png)

Now let's see how to insert a Gantt chart in Google sheets.

### Step #4. Change Bar Chart Appearance Into a Gantt Chart

Click on the **Start Date** bar on the chart. In our example, it's represented by the color blue.

As we click on it, the series section opens up in the customizer on the right sidebar.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PP8vrDSjDQr7yFbWCKNB6LCEosk.png)

Next, click the **Fill Opacity** drop-down menu and go for **0% opacity**.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/7zl9Pyv4JrvqqHlUqS1E9zW82mA.png)

How to add a Gantt chart in Google sheets? Guess what! You already did it. 😉

You see, when you change the opacity of the Start Date bar to 0%, your stacked bar chart resembles a classic Gantt Chart.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/VVpGkRdweSus4wuMNLoJi20xf4.png)

Now the question remains, how to edit Gantt chart in Google sheets?

So for that, you can use the customizer, which offers various elements to customize every section of your Gantt chart.

### Step #5. Customize Your Gantt Chart

We'll start with basic customizing options first.

#### #1. Chart Style

Click on **Customizer** > **Chart Style**. Or you can simply double click on the chart to edit it.

You can change the background color, font style, and chart border color from here.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ELYQbmV73nun1fbfoSNubRf6nE.png)

Furthermore, you can also tick on one of these boxes – **Maximize**, **3D**, **Compare mode** – to change the view of your Gantt chart.

For example, we thought of presenting our chart in 3D, and here's how it looks.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/IYDANwa4HUqZqcE8r7RqeEohFs.png)

Next, for those unaware, we'll show how to change title of Gantt chart on Google sheets.

#### #2. Chart & Axis titles

Click on **the Chart & axis titles&#x20;**&#x65;lement below the chart style. From this section, you can change the chart title text, font style, size, and colors.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/rGTG20w47XF8RKCoMY6kjRBKfo.png)

#### #3. Legend

What's a legend?🤔

Nah, we’re not talking about Dwayne Johnson.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/keGbvzkciVbFSoHPeejnr7fAWA.gif)

A legend in charts resembles the various types of data in the Gantt chart.

In our dataset, we have two legends.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/50C4mImYN6VD2GsO6jS7apUneE.png)

Ideally, a Gantt chart doesn't require a legend since we have to visualize a single dataset, i.e., Task Duration.

It's better to hide the legend column and give more space to the actual chart. Here's how to do it.

Open **Customizer** > **Legend** > **Position** > **None**

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QNnGZOQyy8jvbgUofYfupvXmu4.png)

### Step #6. Add Dependencies to Your Gantt chart

Adding dependencies allows you to create a dynamic Gantt chart that updates in real time.

Dependencies here mean that tasks depend on one another's initiation or completion.

Using Google sheets formulas, you can easily map dependencies among tasks. Below we have explained three significant dependencies around Gantt charts.

#### #1. End a Task to Start Another

The dependency means a task can only be started once the previous task is completed.

**💭 Think about it:**  Which task can be completed before another can start?

For example, in our dataset, _Unit Tests_ can only be started once _Designing&#x20;_&#x69;s complete. So here, Unit Tests (B5) depend on Designing (C4).

So we’ll put this formula in B5: **=MAX(C4)+1**

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JHduzHIpis4pgIJOpts6C3Ie6so.png)

The date in B5 will automatically push one day further to the date of completion of the previous task.

#### #2. Start a Task Before Ending Another

In some cases, we start a task without ending the previous task. No kidding! We actually do that.

In fact, managers often do that because each task is interlinked in one way or another.

For instance, we might start the design tasks without ending the coding tasks because we may also require some coding from a design perspective.

In such dependencies, we create a buffer period for the previous task. So, we'll add this formula at the end date of the coding task (C2):**=MIN(B4)+4**

Here, B4 is the start date of the dependent task, and +4 is the additional number of days the task will remain active after the initiation of another task.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/gEp420x0QsqkLRzf6efpm3jGRRk.png)

#### #3. Finish to Finish

In this, a task must finish in order to finish another.

As in our example, Improvements (C9) need extra days to complete even after final testing (C10).

You see, you might encounter a problem during final testing and choose to improve instead of launch.

In C9, use this formula:**=MIN(C10)+1**

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/G833A0LyMCELt2AExUnU7swvyk8.png)

This formula conveys that Improvements need one buffer day to finish after final testing is done and dusted.

## Drawbacks of Creating Charts with Sheets

### #1. Not a Mobile-friendly Platform

Google sheets might seem like one, but it isn't a mobile-friendly platform.

Although it does offer a dedicated mobile app, the process becomes even more complicated compared to the web version, especially when creating Gantt charts.

Creating Gantt charts requires you to input formulas and perform numerous calculations on the go. Things get worse when you need to do all these with a poor navigational design and weakly-optimized mobile responsiveness.

Gsheets have both disadvantages. You may often find it exhausting to scroll through rows and columns. Plus, you may often encounter incomplete graphs needing you to scroll over and view them in two perfect halves.

Too much scrolling, right? In some time, we'll show you how Datapad (our tool) helps you overcome this issue.

### #2. Time Consuming & Labour Intensive

Similar to Excel, Gsheets is not a gen z tool.

Gen z prefers AI as an assistant or to automate things, unfortunately, Google sheets have next to no AI - processes.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/zKrXDX0zT3FiAOzHGdsJDwGZQpY.gif)

A step or another, you would be compelled to press, enter, click, or type the future action to create charts.

Like previously, you saw an intensive 6-step process on how to create a Gantt chart in Google sheets.

It's tough out there.😪

### #3. Might Slow Down When Processing Hefty Datasets

Descending from a mighty-mighty company (Alphabet), Sheets aren't the first choice when dealing with complex datasets.

You may often face problematic situations like

- Mishandling of data

- Lags and glitches when scrolling or performing calculations

- Unresponsive sheets

Besides, for companies dealing in terabytes of data, Google sheets automatically become a second choice to modern-day chart creation tools like Datapad.

Sheets, at max, offer [10,000,000 cells](https://blog.golayer.io/google-sheets/google-sheets-limitations) for new and converted documents. Evidently, it needs 100,000X more cells to fit in a terabyte of data.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/rMvJzvrEjQM5uozBxrGBVoHM68E.gif)

### #4. Limited Customization Options

Sheets has a customize tab but it offers limited options. You're limited to choosing from a set of pre-built charts which were last updated a decade ago.

Moreover, none of the charts turn out to be appreciated as stunning!

Simply put, charts prepared in Gsheets aren't aesthetically pleasing for viewers. And there's little you can do to enhance it.

Instead, as customizations, you can only edit the chart's fundamentals like title, fonts, text, and so on.
