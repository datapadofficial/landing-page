Some of the best AI tools for data visualization are Datapad, Tableau, Polymer, Power BI, Luzmo, Infogram, ThoughtSpot, Domo, and Akkio.

In this article, we discuss these best AI data visualization tools – their features, pricing, pros, and cons.

But first, let's look at some factors that you should consider when choosing an AI tool for data visualization.

## Factors to consider when choosing an AI tool for Data Visualization

Before investing in an AI-integrated data visualization software, consider these factors:

### 1. Your Data Needs

Identify whether you work with structured, unstructured, numerical, textual, or spatial data. Different tools have varying capabilities in handling different data types.

Next, assess the size and complexity of your datasets. And whether it requires advanced visualization capabilities like heatmaps, sunbursts, or dot plot charts.

### 2. Rich Visualization Options

Ensure that the tool has a diverse range of visualization elements – charts, graphs, tables, maps, and more, that align with your data analysis needs. 

Look for the level of customization and interactivity in visualization. For example, can you click to drill down on the visual? Or can you customize visual elements (colors, labels, interactivity)? 

### 3. The Level of AI Integration

AI tools can integrate AI into the platform at various levels. Some offer AI as a layover, allowing you to interact with your data. Others integrate it deep within the platform to help create AI dashboards and reports and perform ad-hoc analysis.

### 4. Connectivity with Other Apps and Data Sources

Integration with your existing tech stack and data sources is a must. Look for tools with plug-and-play integrations to popular data sources for easy data import. This will save you time and the hassle of looking for another tool to connect multiple data sources with your tool.
