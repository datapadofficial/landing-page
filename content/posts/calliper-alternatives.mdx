Calliper is an AI-powered virtual data scientist that analyzes data from product, finance, and support and automatically delivers actionable customer insights.

Business owners and employees use Calliper to build dashboards for multiple departments – leadership, marketing, sales, finance, and more.

However, when you need a tool with a high number of integrations and an easier setup process, you must look for an alternative.

In this article, I will tell you why you should try an alternative to Calliper and discuss the best ones in the market.

## Why Do You Need a Calliper Alternative?

There are two major reasons why you need a Calliper alternative:

- Limited integrations

- The setup process is slow

Let’s dig into these reasons one by one.

### Reason 1. Limited Integrations

When building reports and tracking KPIs, integrations play a key role. Any software you use must integrate with multiple sources to give you a chance to track each and every KPI essential for your business.

When I looked at the integrations Calliper offers, I felt that it’s missing integrations from the e-commerce and email marketing sectors. The software doesn’t integrate with Shopify, Squarespace, Mailchimp, or any similar tool.

### Reason 2. The Setup Process is Easy But Slow

When I tried setting up Calliper for my business, I was a little disappointed. 

The onboarding process is decent and fast, but one major drawback I discovered was that when you integrate any Calliper with any software, it takes 24 hours for Calliper to collect data related to your business.

So you have to wait for a day after integrating the platform to all data sources you need and then go into building reports and tracking KPIs.

## What are the Best Calliper Alternatives and Competitors?

Some of the best alternatives to Calliper are:

When running a business, building and analyzing reports is a crucial part of your daily or weekly operations. But let’s face it: building reports isn’t as easy as it sounds. You must know which metrics to choose when designing the right charts to bring together a thorough report.
