AI tools have now become a vital part of every business. Why? That‚Äôs because these tools are transforming how organizations function by making the team more lean, improving productivity across the organization, and getting you more ROI.

Using AI smartly can help you streamline workflow, automate recurring tasks, and make your team lean and more efficient.

In this article, we discuss the top 9 AI tools you can use for your business. You can use any one of them, or you can use them all for different departments of your business.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing an AI Tool for Business

Here are the top 4 factors that you must consider when choosing any AI software for your business.

### 1. Relevance

The market offers AI tools for different use cases, such as content creation, process automation, data analysis, custom relationship management, and project management. Consider which area of your business requires AI assistance. Then, look for AI tools that fulfill those requirements.

### 2. Easy-of-Use

New tools involve a fair learning curve. The same is true when you invest in an AI tool for business. A lot goes on behind the scenes, rather than just paying for the subscription costs.

Introducing a new tool to your team may backfire, especially if your team believes in traditional business methodologies. And not everyone is comfortable or acquainted with using AI.

To make it less intrusive and more inclusive, choose a tool with a user-friendly interface that involves easy navigation and click-and-done functions. Also, see if the software has enough self-help guides, documentation, and customer support in case of a bottleneck.

### 3. Customizable and Scalable

Look for AI tools that can be trained and tailored to fit your marketing strategies and objectives. Tools like Datapad, Canva, HubSpot, and Trello offer easy customization and flexibility to scale as your business grows.

### 4. Cost-Effectiveness

Unless you're surplus on revenue, every investment must deliver a heavy ROI. A quick discussion with key stakeholders and team members is also needed before deciding.

Decide on a budget for the tool and check for hidden costs. Consider tools with team plans rather than per-user pricing. Generally, annual plans are offered at discounted rates and might best suit long-term use in your business.
