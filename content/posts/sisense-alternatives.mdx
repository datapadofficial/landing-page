Sisense helps you convert data into revenue by building AI-powered analytics with pro-code, low-code, and no-code capabilities.

The software is used by the likes of Philips, Verizon, Skullcandy, and many more, but the real question you must ask yourself is whether Sisense is a great BI and data visualization tool for your business or whether you need to explore Sisense alternatives.

In this article, I will discuss the major reasons why you might need a Sisense alternative and then discuss the top ones out there in the market.

## Why Do You Need a Sisense Alternative?

There are three primary reasons why you might be interested in a Sisense alternative:

- Updating Sisense often distorts dashboards
- Sisense has problems handling large datasets
- Sisense falls short when compared to Power BI or Tableau

Let’s drill down each reason and get to know why these reasons cause problems.

### Reason 1: Updating Sisense Often Distorts Dashboards

Let’s face it, creating KPI dashboards isn’t a piece of cake. You need to keep an eye on a bunch of KPIs, shortlist the most effective ones depending on what you want to track, put them together in a dashboard, and then get to analyzing them.

With Sisense, every update the software gets is a nightmare for you and your team tracking KPIs. Existing users have complained about dashboards going broke with every new software update due to new bugs or new ways of doing things.

### Reason 2: Sisense Has Problems Handling Large Datasets 

Sisense isn’t good at handling large datasets. Users often face elastic cube build failures (a way to organize and analyze large amounts of data) when dealing with a considerable amount of data.

Even if the build was successful, they were inconsistent, making it difficult to reconcile data in a few seconds.

### Reason 3: It Falls Short When Compared to Power BI or Tableau

A user complained about Sisense falling short when compared to other data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.

Here are the points of concern the user raised:

- The data model view is very clunky, which makes it difficult to understand the relationships of the data easily.
- Sisense is missing a basic functionality of the min and max date filter.
- Haven’t found a way to incorporate user-inputted parameters into dashboards.
- Formula syntax is clunky and weird.
