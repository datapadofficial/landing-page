### Key Features

#### #1. Automatic or Manual Data Upload

Data being the foremost ingredient for your dashboard is also the #1 priority for teams. Therefore, importing tons of data to your dashboard should be an error-free process.

Unfortunately, importing tens and thousands of data from multiple data sources isn't what every KPI tool can perform flawlessly. Some tools lack key integrations, while others lack automation.

But Datapad has the upper hand in both cases.

It allows you to import data automatically via one-click integrations and manually.

If you want to import data quickly, you can use our one-click integrations with popular data sources like Google Sheets, Facebook, Google Analytics, and many more to import data and create stunning dashboards in a few minutes.

Here's how you can easily set your data import process on auto-pilot:

- Simply press the** '+'** sign you see at the bottom of the screen
- Go to** Use a Data Source** option 
- And you will see all the data sources to import your data from

To do the process manually, simply click on **'Enter Manually,'** and then you're in control of your data.
