Let’s be honest, we all agree Excel is an old-school talk!

Yet, with over [1.1 Billion users globally](https://www.microbizmag.co.uk/microsoft-excel-statistics/), it still holds the ground when it comes to data management and visualizations. 🤯. In this guide, you’ll discover:

1. Why interactive dashboards supercharge your reporting

2. Exactly how to build one from raw data to live visuals

3. 5 free templates to kickstart your own dashboard

4. Pro tips to overcome Excel’s limitations

Can’t wait for that long? Here’s a quick summary of the article:

- An interactive dashboard in Excel is a type of dashboard where you can track KPIs and metrics with your team, change data as per your business KPIs fluctuate, and track changes in real-time.
- To create an interactive dashboard in Excel, you first need to create interactive charts. To do so, you first have to convert your data into a Pivot table.
- These pivot tables will then be used to create interactive charts which will then go on the Excel dashboard.
- Creating an interactive dashboard in Excel is tough and has limitations. It’s not scalable, has limited data visualization, and doesn’t have a high level of security. To overcome all these challenges, we built Datapad.
- Datapad is a dashboarding solution to create interactive dashboards, bring your team onboard, and track KPIs from anywhere in the world from your mobile device.

Let’s transform your spreadsheets into dynamic, interactive reports!

## What Is an Interactive Dashboard in Excel?

An interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel is a one-pager (mostly, but not always) report that allows business teams to track and measure crucial business KPIs and metrics under one roof.

It consists of a combination of charts, figures, and tables that visualize complex and hard-to-understand data in an easy-to-read format.

Besides, creating an interactive dashboard in Excel is fun. You get to learn most of the Excel functionalities and meanwhile have an opportunity to create something stunning, which would make your stakeholders go wow for the job! 😮

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/zKMCW4OvUTm7mxLOcMmwAHPzog.gif)

So, are you ready?

Let’s rightaway jump to the section where we’ll see how to make an interactive dashboard in Excel.

## How to Create an Interactive Dashboard in Excel? A Step-By-Step Tutorial

### Steps #1. Define the Purpose of Your Dashboard

Before starting the process, let us ask: *Why are you creating this dashboard and for whom?*

Different stakeholders or departments within the organization would want to analyze different facts and figures.

For instance, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would prefer looking at key financial metrics, while an investor would want a summarized dashboard of all the departments.

Keeping this in mind, try to attach a purpose to your dashboard and then collect data around it for accurate and effective decision-making.

### Step #2: Source In Data and Create a Pivot Table

Here’s a raw data set we will be using to create an interactive dashboard in Excel.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/BrEFmOhwwxrcjP7A74HDPRGew.png)

Let’s first convert this dataset into a table (you can skip this if you already have a table).

Select your data, go to **Insert** > **Table**. In the pop-up that opens, tick the box - **‘My table has headers,’** and click **OK**.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/BampEH3U5R99fFvlYg7TsatufA.png)

Your table will look something like this:

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/R9jHf84gVGuiPXsaNjuES3JyI.png)

Next, convert the table into Pivot table; this will help you create interactive charts to put in your dashboard in Excel. Select the table, go to **Insert Tab** > **Pivot Table**. Click on **OK** and you will have a new sheet with Pivot Table.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/FNwcPzh3oGJgmkMyYBBJl1AeIaQ.png)

For our interactive Excel dashboard we want 3 charts, meaning we need 3 pivot tables. To do so, we will just duplicate the pivot table sheet in the Excel workbook.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aQGdhJx6KGn9hf6shMvpEbnmhw.png)

And just like that you have 3 pivot tables ready. Let’s move on to the next step to create charts for our interactive dashboard.

### Step #3: Create Charts with Pivot Table

So our first chart would represent every product’s monthly-wise sale.

For that we need 3 data entries - Sales, Product, and Month.

In the Pivot table sheet, drag and drop the Month data in the rows area, product in the columns area, and Sales in the values area.

Here’s a GIF to explain it to you clearly:

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/38u15qFL31w11qD824olWba6i8.gif)

If you want, arrange the values in decreasing or increasing order.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/lRMLgIRkTnsbWS34yZjN8gBQ.png)

Next, click anywhere on the Pivot Table as soon as you do that, you will see a tab - **PivotTable Analyze** appears in the top menu.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/45SS8NhuaSXapnwvAfF2URUyM.png)

Next, click on **PivotChart** inside the PivotTable Analyze menu and choose the chart you want to represent your data. In our case, we’re choosing **Stacked columns **from the chart drop-down.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/63Jf6lKxOnlfnhf9JnGrqoGER10.png)

The moment you press OK, a pivot chart will appear in front of you.

Volia! You have made your first chart.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/mNdixYG7nRFlxNNVRUzUSwSLg.png)

Now, it’s time to style the chart via formatting options in Excel.

Let’s start by giving the chart a title:

Click on the **+** sign that you see besides the chart you just created, tick the **‘Chart Title’** box, and give your chart a suitable title.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/nwqvb897CRMmmO8qHtGUHfpFI.png)

Excel has some basic formatting options that you can use to make your chart look better:

- **Chart Title: **Change the title of your chart
- **Legend: **Enable, disable, and edit legend as needed
- **Axes: **Edit horizontal axis and vertical axis of your chart
- **Data Table:** Insert a table that represents all values in a data table

Try them out and see how you want your pivot chart.

After you’re done formatting, you can then move your chart to the Interactive dashboard sheet.

Repeat the procedure to create such pivot table charts for your interactive dashboard, once you’re done, we’d start formatting and customizing our interactive dashboard.

When it comes to creating charts, Excel gives you a boatload of options:

- Bar charts or column charts
- Pie charts
- Line charts
- Area charts

And many more…

Here’s how our dashboard looks after creating 3 charts.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Hu3TpEvihSHM9za28vMigqsGY.png)

### Step #4. Add Interactive Features to Your Dashboard Design

Select any chart you want on your interactive dashboard and click on **PivotChart Analyze**. Go ahead and click on **Insert Timeline**.

**Note:** For inserting a timeline to any pivot chart, you **MUST** have the Date column in your data.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DCwrKjqMLN4SuplLRPY4Z3MXf2M.png)

Tick the Date checkbox and press **OK**.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/GB9H2DiCLsbdsLQ9yzU3K7ZOz8.png)

This will give you a timeline of the chart.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/BoEkB6FgRlOdIxJ2BSjSpjsDTF8.png)

In a similar fashion you can add slicer for all the charts you want to on the interactive dashboard.

Here’s the snapshot of our final interactive dashboard in Excel:

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Sc1GJqOPNZsPXs5bPbLY70YsM8.png)

Doesn’t it look pretty?

Now that you’ve seen how to create an interactive dashboard in Excel, it’s time to explore some templates that you can use directly.

## Drawbacks of Creating Dashboards in Excel

### #1. Limited Scalability

Excel struggles with large amounts of data and may become slow and unresponsive. In some cases, you can encounter downtime when multiple users try to access a spreadsheet simultaneously.

Both ways, Excel is not the first choice for organizations willing to scale their operations from time to time.

Besides, Excel is a stand-alone application. It does not integrate with other platforms or data sources easily. This makes it challenging for companies with data spread across multiple social and analytical platforms to centralize them under an Excel sheet.

### #2. Limited Data Visualization Options

With Excel, you are limited to using a set of pre-built data visualization elements.

Yes, the platform does offer customization options, but that too is shrunk to basic editing of charts. 📊

Suppose we compare Excel's gallery of data visualization elements to Datapad (our tool) or any modern-day dashboard software. The other is more advanced in creating visually appealing and informative dashboards.

### #3. Lack of Collaboration Features

Excel doesn't have built-in collaboration features like Datapad. Meaning you cannot communicate on the go. You have to use a third-party app for real-time communication.

**P.S.** Datapad helps you eliminate this bottleneck. How? We'll talk about this feature in a later section.

For now, Excel has no control over what version of the application users work upon – 2013, 2016, or 2019. This makes it difficult for users using a different version to experience the exact same dashboard which others are using.

And when a team uses different versions to access the same dashboard, what they view entirely depends on what their version supports.

**Our POV:** You can’t do anything except circulating a disclaimer to your team asking them to use the same version.

### #4. Limited Security Options

Excel does not have built-in security options, making it easy for unauthorized users to access and modify data. This can often lead to data manipulation and inaccurate results.

### #5. Limited Automation

Being from a 90's background, Excel comes with next-to-no automation. In fact, its users spend most of their time preparing data and double-checking it manually.

Simply put, Excel does not have the ability to automate the process of data collection and updating. This leads to a lot of manual work, thereby increasing the chances of human errors or unintentional data manipulation.

👇🏻 They reply under your comment (and then the conversion can go on)

Simply put, it works similarly to Twitter threads.
