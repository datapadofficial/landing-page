Bar graphs in Google Sheets ain‚Äôt old school. Yes, someone has to say it! ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è

They are the most fundamental chart type used by business owners and financial analysts to display complicated data in an easy-to-read format.

Besides, they are a convenient way to visualize information quickly and effectively.

In this article, we will walk you through on how to make bar graphs in Google Sheets.

Let‚Äôs start with answering the most basic question.

## What are Bar Graphs in Google Sheets?

A bar graph is a graphical representation that uses a combination of bars and numeric values to present complex data in an easy-to-understand manner.

Simply put, a bar graph _(aka bar charts or column graphs)_ plots numeric values against levels of rectangular blocks known as bars.

These **levels** are plotted on one chart axis (let's say the x-axis) and **values** on the other axis (y-axis). Each value claims one bar, and the height of each bar corresponds to the value they represent.

Here's how a typical bar graph looks in Google Sheets.

‚Äç

![google sheets bar graph example](https://framerusercontent.com/images/n2c3ZSowAEIuU0QuVIrjyhk4JYw.png)

Moreover, as you can see in the image, bars are plotted on a common baseline to allow for easy measurement and comparison of values.

This is just one type of bar graph. Google Sheets, however, offers you an array of bar chart styles to visualize data.

### #1. Horizontal Bar Graphs

![Horizontal sales bar graph](https://framerusercontent.com/images/sPYbNJBikoUFLxmshLjLHs2p8gI.png)

In these types of bar graphs, the rectangular bars are horizontally drawn on the y-axis, and the x-axis shows the value corresponding to each bar.

### #2. Vertical Bar Graphs

Unlike horizontal bar graphs, here, the rectangular bars are vertically drawn on the x-axis, and the y-axis shows the value corresponding to each bar.

### #3. Stacked Bar Chart

![google sheets stacked bar chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UA4gij9vJ66hJSJ0pQYE80NbMs.png)

The stacked bar graph (or composite bar graph) divides the whole bar into several segments. Each segment is colored and labeled differently to quickly identify individual categories.  

### #4. 100% Stacked Bar Graph

![100% Stacked Bar Graph](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ah4Fj9lCnqSHVQUrlFsMY2wGMjg.png)

Similar to stacked bar graphs, this graph also splits the bar into colored segments based on different categories. The only difference is, in a 100% stacked bar graph, the stacked bar always equals 100%, i.e., each bar height is always 100%.

## Why and When to Use Bar Graphs?

**üí≠ Food For Thought:**  Bar graphs are the best way of data handling while working on Google Sheets.

It's an excellent tool to represent data that are independent of one another and that don't need to be in any specific order for being represented.

Besides, bar graphs are especially used when you want to show a distribution of data points or compare performance over time.

From a bar chart, we can see which groups are the highest or most common and how the groups compare against each other.

But what makes bar graphs popular among data analysts compared to other charts?

Here are the reasons for it.

### #1. They‚Äôre Easy to Read and Understand

Because bar graphs are widely used in publishable formats like textbooks, marketing reports, and research papers, many people already know how it works and what it represents.

We mean, it's ok if a higher-secondary school kid tells you the information that a bar graph conveys. It's that common and easy to grasp.

Unlike other types of graphs, such as [pie charts](https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-make-a-pie-chart-in-google-sheets), histograms, and area charts, bar graphs are really straightforward. Its simplicity makes it a good choice when you want to make your data understandable to a diversified audience segment. 

### #2. Perfect for Mapping Changes Overtime

Another prolific advantage of bar graphs is their ability to visualize trends in an easy-to-understand format.

Other graphs, such as pie charts, can only represent one data set (mostly).

For instance, if you‚Äôre conducting a yearly survey with 100 people asking them their choice of smartphone and then showing the percentage of people opting for different preferences, you need some form of visual aid to express it. 

In such cases, a bar graph could be handy to show how people's choices change over time. Anyone can look at the chart and identify which smartphone is people's choice for the current year.  

Furthermore, you can also compare that information to past surveys and analyze trends to map the changes in trends over time.

Until now, you might have figured out why using a bar graph to visualize your data can be a wise choice. 

So, let's skip to the good part.

## How to Make Bar Graphs in Google Sheets?

Although making a bar graph in Google Sheets is no rocket science, it might be a cumbersome process for newbies. Down the line, we have tried decoding the process of creating bar graphs in an easy step-by-step guide.

You can watch the video below or read the step by step instructions, the choice is up to you ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëá

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/XE3iEWkSSAh76tNmj7ILIo7K4j8.png)

Now, you can visualize this data in 3-simple steps:

### Step 1: Rows and Columns Selection

Select the cells you would like to visualize (including the headers)

![Step 1: Rows and Columns Selection](https://framerusercontent.com/images/3oQeKs7Xkin7S9jnC11DGS63Dk.png)

### **Step 2:**  Chart Icon In Menu

Click on the '**Chart Icon**' on the right side of your toolbar.

![Step 2: Chart Icon In Menu](https://framerusercontent.com/images/SdvWPJAdZktPxRIDyk1oREPKzI.png)

‚Äç

As you click the icon, Google Sheets will automatically present the dataset with a default chart type. 

See how it did for our dataset üëáüèª

![visualising data](https://framerusercontent.com/images/xib9pHm4ZL3eYVKgvSeUMyLhBQ8.png)

Next, click on **Setup** in the chart editor on the right-hand sidebar. Then click on **Chart Type&#x20;**&#x64;ropdown to choose any graph from the Bar or Column section.

‚Äç

![google sheets chart editor](https://framerusercontent.com/images/uVjC0BMpuum7wHv8xke9hIlj95g.png)

**Note:&#x20;**&#x54;he vertical form of a bar graph is named Columns in Google Sheets to avoid confusion, but both fall under the bar graph category. 

### Step 3: Bar Graph Selection

Select the type of bar graph. For visualizing a single dataset, select a single bar of column charts.

Once selected, this is how the above data set will be displayed.

![Step 3: Bar Graph Selection](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jeOzRR41W91YSsoKCSlfka1DII.png)

That's it! You have successfully made your first bar graph in Google Sheets.

So after you‚Äôve created your bar graph from the steps above, here‚Äôs how to customize it further.

## Bar Graph Customization

For those aware, the graphs you create in Google sheets offer many customization options, such as editing the graph title and axis titles, changing bar and background colors, placing labels, and even customizing the font style.

Let's see how you can customize each one of them.

To get started, double-click on the graph to open the chart editor sidebar (or it might already be there if you haven't closed it yet).

Then, click on the **Customize&#x20;**&#x74;ab. A drop-down appears with a list of customizable items.

![sheets chart editor ](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wgbhI7TMRsfQWVC5wK1Li4Do49I.png)

Let's drill down the items in the list one by one.

#### #1. Chart Type

From here, you can customize the chart's background color, font style, and border color.

![choose chart type](https://framerusercontent.com/images/d1ModN4DP79Gt8kAA3BlzBRXcg.png)

Moreover, you can change how people view your chart by checking the 3 boxes:

- **Maximize:**  Zoom in on the chart by cutting out the white space

- **3D:**  To give your bar graph a three-dimensional effect 

- **Compare Mode:**  To lay a comparison between each bar (this isn't required as bar graphs are by default comparable graphs)

Here‚Äôs the Chart Type option in action:

![3D chart type](https://framerusercontent.com/images/15SX6slfUuc5UkBzYaGXZXxrX20.png)

#### #2. Chart and Axis Titles

Next, click on **Chart and axis titles** to edit the chart title/subtitle or change both axis titles. Besides you can also format the title fonts, size, and color.

![sheets chart editor](https://framerusercontent.com/images/9ixSMiFC9S4pSMOaSjwKayekuxA.png)

This feature will help you personalize your chart according to your brand and also create white-label charts for your clients.

Here‚Äôs how creative minds at Datapad use this feature:

#### #3. Series

You can change the colors for each of the bars in the graph from the Series section.

To do so, expand the ‚Äò**Series‚Äô** section in the chart editor sidebar. Then click on **Apply To All Series** dropdown and select the series you want to customize.

![revenue vs profit chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/tUWgXy23qqEcIWCrBRaVioWMz7k.png)

‚Äç

You can then change the fill and line color for the bars and also change the % of the opacity of colors. Moreover, you can choose the line type and thickness.

![revenue vs profit sheets chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/KsJbl1JhhUiykMLq2JqUtvLrLHo.png)

#### #4. Format Data Points

You can find the Format data point option in the same section, Series. This is mainly used to highlight a specific bar on the chart to make it stand out.

![sheets formatting data points](https://framerusercontent.com/images/6qq7iBKn9tF1yECIOjAxyAzI95g.png)

For example, if you want your highest profit month to stand out from the other bars in the graph, you can do it via the Format data point option. 

Click on th&#x65;**&#x20;Add&#x20;**&#x62;utton beside the format data point text.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/nYig2AVi3FlAdjBSk80IoIlnv0.png)

A pop-up appears asking you to select a data point.

![select data point](https://framerusercontent.com/images/p8etGE6d3JixiMxkjXWNSxJwKAM.png)

Choose from the dropdown and press **OK**.

![dropdown menu](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ef83QnkfllXiLfzibobqPnwOpI.png)

Then, pivot to the chart editor, where you will be provided with several color options to choose from (choose the color you want to use as a highlighter).

![choose colour for chart](https://framerusercontent.com/images/DnJUJ0ELxeBoRjIOk5blVzxGE4.png)

Choose a predefined color or create your custom color; totally up to you.

Meanwhile, your selected dataset will change colors in real-time as you click on random colors.

**Note:**  You can always change the data point and color later on.

#### #5. Data Labels

Click on the **Data Labels** checkbox to add or customize labels to each bar. You can also change the **font type**, **size**, and **colors** of the labels.

![data labels](https://framerusercontent.com/images/HwVfPyZqdPRWl3BaS2KZEAFRc.png)

These were all the major customization options that you might need when creating bar graphs in Google Sheets.

There are some more customization options that you can check out on your own, such as:

- Horizontal axis customization

- Vertical axis customization

- Legend axis insertion

- Gridlines and ticks

- Axis labels insertion 

And that's it! You have customized every section of the bar graph and created a full-fledged bar graph in Google Sheets. 

Achievement Unlocked! üéâ

You might have felt there are tons of customizations available on G Sheets for creating data visualizations, but the truth is that Google Sheets is far behind in visualizing KPIs.

Here‚Äôs why!

## Drawbacks of Monitoring KPIs with Google Sheets

### #1. Limited Automation

Despite being a product of Google, it's uncommon to find that G Sheets provide next to no automation. 

Even with the data extraction and management process, Google Sheets doesn‚Äôt provide any helpful automation. Instead, you are required to manually input and edit data to your Google Sheet dashboard. 

That sounds tedious and is actually tiring.

### #2. Hard to Onboard Your Whole Team

If you‚Äôre tracking metrics with your team, things can get messy because someone can tamper the sheet, or everyone can keep their own version which breaks the single source of truth.

What‚Äôs worse, Google Sheets slows down once there are too many collaborators accessing the sheets at the same time. Besides, it has a comparably poor UI for efficiently managing team activities.

Some standard dashboarding features like assigning tasks, real-time communication, time tracking, and accounting for internal databases cannot be achieved with Google Sheets dashboards.

Everything adds up to the fact that Google Sheets is not a team-friendly tool.

### #3. Bad Mobile Experience 

What if you want to check your metrics on the go? Let's be honest. Google Sheets aren't a great choice for it.

You see, dashboards created on Gsheets are not mobile-friendly. Although you can access them from your mobile, it still requires you to pinch your phone every time to navigate through your dashboard.

There are also chances of unintentionally hampering the data and dashboard layout when working through an unresponsive mobile interface. 

So what can you do? 

You can try one of the best alternatives to Google Sheets.üëáüèª
