If you are outside the United States when you visit the website, web application or engage in communications with us via mail, e-mail or telephone, please be aware that your personal data may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located. Any information you provide to us, or that we collect through your use of the websites or web applications will be stored, processed, and transferred within or to the United States.

Note also that your personal data may be available to the US Government or its agencies under legal process in the United States.</p><p>‍</p><h2>EEA and United Kingdom Privacy Rights</h2><p>The Legal Basis for Using EEA and UK Personal data</p><p>For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), we advise that your personal data will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different from those in your country and may not be as protective. The United States has not sought or received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal data is to do so with your consent; where we need the personal data for performance of a contract or requested service, including to provide you with our Newsletter, or where the collection and use is in our or another’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the personal data in question. If we collected your personal data with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.</p><p>Our retention of your personal data and any subsequent communications are based on our legitimate interest in providing you with new and potentially relevant materials based on your geography, role, or company. As always, you can elect to opt out from receiving such future communications.</p><p>To the extent that we transfer Personal data from the EEA, to a jurisdiction outside the EEA that has not been adduced by the European Commission as providing adequate data protections (such as the United States), we will ensure that such personal data is safeguarded through appropriate contractual terms or other approved mechanisms.</p><p>Rights for EEA and UK Residents</p><p>In addition, if you are a resident of the EEA or United Kingdom you have the right to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Find out if we use your personal data, to access your personal data, and receive copies of your personal data.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Withdraw any express consent that you have provided to the processing of your personal data at any time without penalty.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Access your personal data and have it corrected or amended if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Obtain a transferable copy of some of your personal data which can be transferred to another provider when the personal data was processed based on your consent.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>If you believe your personal data is inaccurate, no longer necessary for our business purposes, or if you object to our processing of your personal data, you also have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your data pending our investigation and/or verification of your claim.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Request your personal data be deleted or restricted under certain circumstances. For example, if using your personal data on the basis of your consent and has no other legal basis to use such, you may request your personal data be deleted when you withdraw your consent.</p></li></ul><p>Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p><p>If we ask you to provide personal data to us to comply with a legal requirement or enter into a contract, we will inform you of this and let you know whether providing us with your personal data is required and if not, the consequences of not sharing your personal data with us.</p><p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our or a third party’s legitimate interests and those interests are not already described above, we will let you know what those legitimate interests are.</p><p>We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>To withdraw consent or exercise these rights, please contact us via email at <a href=""mailto:hello@datapad.io"">hello@datapad.io</a>.</p><p>If you are not satisfied with our response, or believe we are processing your personal data in violation of the law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Supervisory Authority (also known as Data Protection Authority) or other appropriate governmental authority in your EEA Member State. You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority.

We use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers – 256 bit) for protecting your information.&nbsp;</p><p>We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Datapad and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Datapad makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Please do not provide your account password to another person. We cannot be responsible for a data breach or other incident if a password is used by unauthorized persons.</p><p>We will keep your personal data in active files or systems as long as needed to meet the purposes for which it was collected, to provide the services or products you requested, or as otherwise may be required by law.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Children’s Privacy</h2><p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.

Datapad does not monitor the user content you post on the website.

To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your Profile Settings or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p><p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal data stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p><p>You may, of course, decline to submit your personal data through Datapad, in which case Datapad may not be able to provide certain services to you.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Compromise of Personal Data</h2><p>In the event that personal data is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Datapad will promptly notify those persons whose personal data has been compromised, in accordance with the Notification Procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p><p>You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal data in public areas, on public bulletin boards or within the website, that information might be collected and disseminated by third parties, and result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from third-parties.
