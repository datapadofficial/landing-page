Before we dive in and talk about the tools you see in the table, let’s understand why you might be looking for a Cyfe alternative.

## Why You Might Look for a Cyfe Alternative?

### Reason #1. Poor User-Interface

Cyfe fails to provide users with a friendly dashboarding solution. Its user interface is often deemed outdated by users.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jmt0nL0bwGWfcitXW0u8TIOeo.png)

Moreover, a poor user interface brings up a steep learning curve for individuals and organizations. For example, some users found it difficult to understand the metrics tracking. 

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/5jpVPY9puyNKKX2UEj3ToOPI.png)

Even the design of the software is pretty simple, not even close to grabbing users' attention.

### Reason #2. Crippled Customization Options

For the most part, Cyfe is not as customizable as you thought it would be. If you have a customized dashboard or a custom theme  in mind you want to use, you can't. Let's look at what Zakary H - a Marketing Manager, says about Cyfe's customization options.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/NBWSKHpBKCDSrwpxLRuTPMZJV28.png)

So, Cyfe is definitely not for marketing professionals. But here's another big thing.

Cyfe doesn't even allow you to customize its pre-built widgets. That's how rigid it can get in terms of customizations.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/a0VkzAM3d8aOOsdcpatEjJFZ7s.png)

### Reason #3. Limited Integrations

Another good reason to choose a Cyfe alternative is its weak integrations.

We came across several feedbacks where users weren't happy with Cyfe's built-in integrations. _And there’s not much you can do about it_ - not our words but customers.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/C48ik4VZAch2DoM07evfFnd0.png)

Imagine creating an incomplete dashboard due to a lack of data sources or trouble importing data from popular services. Why would you even choose that software?

Now that you are aware of why you might need a Cyfe alternative. Let's now look at the complete picture - explore these advanced dashboards that can be perfect for your business.

## What Are the Best Cyfe Alternatives?
