Some of the best AI tools for data analysis are Datapad, Tableau, Polymer, KNIME, Microsoft Power BI, Medallia, AnswerRocket, Luzmo, Akkio, and Adverity.

In this article, we walk you through the selection criteria for AI data analysis tools and talk about the products – their features, pros and cons, and pricing.

## Factors to Look for When Selecting an AI Tool for Data Analysis

There are 5 factors to consider when selecting an AI tool for data analysis:

1. Ease of use and adaptability

2. Model management and updates

3. Analytical accuracy and speed

4. Scalability and performance

5. Automation and analytical capabilities

Let’s see what makes these factors essential individually.

### 1. Ease of Use and Adaptability

Look for AI data analysis tools that are easy to use and navigate, even for non-technical users. A user-friendly design significantly reduces the learning curve for your team. 

Additionally, ensure the software offers self-help resources and doesn't require extensive training sessions or dev ops guidance to master the tool's workings.

### 2. Model Management and Updates

AI models require regular updates and constant learning to maintain accuracy and relevance. Especially as your business data changes over time, it's crucial that the chosen software supports model updates and version control, allowing you to adapt to new data trends and requirements without significant downtime or manual intervention. 

### 3. Analytical Accuracy and Speed

AI can indeed hallucinate. We have seen it with ChatGPT and other AI models, too. Therefore, you must vouch for the tool's analytical accuracy and response time. 

The best way to test the tool's accuracy and reliability is to use the free trial. You can also skim through user reviews to understand any inaccuracies or flaws users have experienced using the platform. 

### 4. Scalability and Performance

As your data grows, the selected tool should be able to scale accordingly. Evaluate the tool's performance with large datasets and its ability to handle increased workloads without compromising speed or accuracy. 

Scalability is essential for future-proofing your data analysis capabilities as business needs evolve.

### 5. Automation and Analytical Capabilities

Look for AI data analysis tools with robust automation and analytical capabilities. They must automate monotonous processes such as data collection, harmonization, and preparation for analysis. 

Additionally, ensure the tool can handle different data formats and analyses, like descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, or prescriptive – based on your business needs.
