## What is a Marketing Dashboard Software?

A marketing dashboard software pulls data from multiple data sources, including web analytics, social media, advertising, and other marketing channels, in real time and displays it on a unified dashboard.

Now since your data is collected in one place, your reporting process becomes significantly easier. You don't have to go back to the lengthy process of manual data entry into Excel (that's one job less).

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/no-facepalm-excel-dBTGeHJ3aIvtJDe4VV)

Moreover, these software emphasizes using visual aids like charts, graphs, heatmaps, tables, timelines, and other data visualization elements to demonstrate your marketing efforts effectively.

Besides, a typical marketing dashboard is a treasure-trove of KPIs and metrics; some of the most popular ones include:

- Website traffic \[SEO or Inorganic]

- Click-through rate \[For email marketing, social media marketing, and more]

- Bounce rate

- Conversion rate \[PPC campaigns, newsletter conversion, etc.]

- Return on advertisements \[ROAS]

And many more‚Ä¶

Apart from these core skills, an excellent marketing dashboard software must adhere to some other qualities, or what we may term _Soft Skills_.

Coming to the main part, choosing a marketing dashboard software is a process in itself, and here are some factors to consider when doing it.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best Marketing Dashboard Tool

### #1. Is It Easy for You to Set Up?

For starters, an easy setup gives you a head-start and the confidence to utilize any software to its max potential. 

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/latenightseth-boom-3o7btNa0RUYa5E7iiQ)

A lot goes on before you can process insights, like connecting to data points, onboarding the team, assigning authorities, and more.

And so, before picking a software, check for its setup reviews and support quality - these two things will give you an idea of what you‚Äôre dealing with in terms of CX.

In fact, some SaaS companies offer 10 to 15 mins software setup time, which is not bad. But since there are a lot of KPI dashboard software options in the market, you should always aim for the best.

### #2. Would It Give You Quick Access to Your Dashboards?

Imagine sitting and staring at your dashboard that‚Äôs buffering forever‚Ä¶

With such a loading speed, it would take you hours just to track a single KPI, let alone multiple marketing dashboards.

Therefore, instead of testing your anxiety levels, ensure that the software is highly responsive. 

Talking of responsiveness, it's a common problem among desktop-ridden dashboards requiring multiple sign-in, more screen time, and lousy loading time. 

Check if the software has a mobile version, allowing you to access your marketing dashboard from anywhere and anytime.

### #3. Beautiful Dashboards

Although it might sound a little off at the start, a better-looking dashboard makes your marketing efforts look better. It's human physiology; things that look better are better.

Several agency marketers consider this an important factor when choosing marketing dashboard tools.

By beautiful dashboards, we don't really mean adding creatives into them. A beautiful dashboard can be minimalistic, neat, and simple; the right blend of colors and elements makes your dashboard easily navigational for the eyes.

Moreover, everyone wants to impress clients with better-looking dashboards. So choose a marketing dashboard software that‚Äôs visually appealing.

Enough about the factors; let's look at some of the best marketing dashboard software out there in the market.

## What Are the Best Marketing Dashboard Software?
