# How to Make Google Sheets Dashboard in 3 Steps

In this guide, we are going to show you how to build a Google Sheets dashboard in 3 easy steps and also talk about the drawbacks of using Google Sheets for creating dashboards.

But before we do that, let's answer a simple question.

## What is a Google Sheets Dashboard?

A Google Sheets dashboard is nothing but live and dynamic charts that you can edit in real-time.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/0DiATlblhZnlqUAQ7CLWbCDbrsU.png)

With GSheets, you can create multiple dashboards for free. But there's a catch; it's not primarily a [KPI dashboard software](https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-dashboard-software) - which means it doesn’t have dashboard-specific features to track KPIs.

You have to do a lot of things manually (which you will see later in this article) and give a lot of time to create a single dashboard, let alone multiple.

But if you're a small business that doesn't have the funds to spend a dime on KPI tracking software, you might as well use Google Sheets.

Let’s walk you through the process of dashboard creation on Google Sheets.

## How to Create a Dashboard in Google Sheets?

### Step 1: Database Creation

To track any KPI, the first thing you need is a database. When it comes to Google Sheet, you have two data sources to extract data from:

- **Google Forms:&#x20;**&#x59;ou might've asked your customers to fill a Google Form; if so, you'd have a ready-made Google Sheet with all the data. This comes in handy when you might want to [track KPIs ](https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-track-kpis)like net promoter score or a demographic-related KPI.

- **Export CSV:&#x20;**&#x4D;aybe you have all your data on a CRM like HubSpot; you can just export the data as a CSV file and open it in Google Sheets.

Whatever method you use, automating database creation isn’t the strong suit of Google Sheet - there are limited options.

For this article, we will take **'Monthly lead conversion'** as an example database.

**Note:**  The list of values you see in the image below are just for example consideration.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/c7HHs92Oknz5hrKWQnGTtBWyCOM.png)

The data you see above is quite simple and straightforward, but if you're dealing with complex data, maybe from Google Analytics and have thousands of rows, you can use the following Google Sheets features to sort and quickly analyze it.

- **Conditional Formatting:&#x20;**&#x53;et colors, conditions, and much more to sort your data 

- **Data Validation:&#x20;**&#x4C;imits the type of input you can enter 

- **Filters:&#x20;**&#x4C;ets you sort data in increasing and decreasing order

- **Vlookup:**  Find and sort data vertically

- **Hlookup:&#x20;**&#x46;ind and sort data horizontally

- **Pivot Table:&#x20;**&#x48;elps sort and isolate data efficiently

So you have your database ready, now is the time to get to the main part.

### Step 2: Generate a Chart

Creating charts in Google Sheets is easy. Just select the range of values (or range of cells) you want to make the chart of. Go to **Insert** and click on **Chart**.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/KyN0RJPB0PM2dzsdXrMZ04TcimM.gif)

With GSheets, you can customize your chart via chart editor. You can:

- Select Chart Type: Column charts, pie charts, bar charts, and much more

- Personalize graphs by adding titles

- Customize charts by adding background color, changing fonts, and more

### Step 3: Convert the Chart into a Dashboard

It's time to bring raw data to life - we mean converting the graph you just created into a custom dashboard.

There are two ways you can convert your chart into a dashboard on Google Sheets.

#### #1. Publish It

When you go for this method, Google Sheets generates a sharable link and publishes your chart on the web. You can share this link with your team members. This also allows you to manage permission of who can edit and view the dashboard.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/aSB5mfE5MfxIfOVRFCZ8btJ6N0.gif)

But there's a major drawback with the publishing method. When you edit your raw data, the dashboard will take forever to reflect those changes. 

To solve this problem, the best way to make a Google Sheets dashboard is by using another method. Let's tell you what that is.

#### #2. Move to Own Sheet Option

Although you will have to keep toggling between tabs time and again, this method reflects changes in real-time.

You can simply click the three dots you see on the top right-hand corner of the chat and select the 'Move to own sheet' option. What this will do is create a new tab in the same sheet and move your charge there. 

You can then see how quickly it reflects changes when you change values in raw data.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/llD1j6mZXJICRw1o65aShKjEI.gif)

Congratulations, you have created a dashboard successfully. 

But wait, there’s more!

### #Bonus: Creating Multiple Dashboards

For any business, tracking 1 KPI isn't enough. So to track multiple KPIs on Google Sheets, you need to repeat the procedure above and keep creating charts and making a dashboard, as shown in step 3.

We know this is labor work, but there's no way around it. After spending 30-40 mins, here’s a dashboard we created. 

Here’s the final version of what our dashboard on Google Sheets looks like.

## Drawbacks of Creating a Dashboard in Google Sheets

### #1 Next to No-Automation

You might think that being one of Google’s hardcore services, Google Sheets must have some sought-after features. But here’s the biggest drawback.

Google Sheets provides next to no automation. For example, if you plan to automate your data extraction and management process, Google Sheets won't help you with any automation to support the cause.

It requires you to manually input and edit every piece of data to your Google Sheet dashboard. However, you can create custom automation by writing a script (some code) or using add-ons such as Zapier to keep your data live.

But again, too much extra work just to import data to your dashboard.

### #2 Hard to Onboard Your Whole Team

Are you creating this dashboard just for your convenience? Or, do you want your team to collaborate with you on crucial metrics and KPIs?

You might wish to add people from different departments to gather constructive feedback or share performance with stakeholders. But here’s the thing.

While Google Sheets is an excellent collaborative tool that allows your team to add data quickly, it slows down once many collaborators are on board. Unfortunate but true!

Google Sheets has a comparably poor interface for managing team activities. It puts you in a blind spot when it comes to project management.

Even some of the day-to-day functions like task management, time tracking, communication, and cataloging of the internal database cannot be achieved with Google Sheets dashboards.

Thus, while creating dashboards with Google Sheets, you must maintain complete documentation of your team activities.

### #3 Poor Mobile-Interface

Unlike other pocket-friendly dashboarding software in the market, Google Sheets is far from the competition.

Google Sheets dashboards are poorly optimized for mobile devices. That means the features available on its mobile version are comparably lesser than what its desktop version offers.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CvrEd9khT0LOYpH6zdrynMTQKE.png)

On another note, since Google Sheets lacks automation, managing tons of data under your fingertips gets you prone to errors. 

### #4 No Scaling Option

As an organization grows, so does its database. Hence, it’s expected for any data management software to scale as your business grows.

However, the number of rows and columns in Google Sheets is limited to 10 Million cells. 

The number might sound friendly for small teams, but for large organizations that collect millions of data daily, the scarcity of cells might cause a halt in their overall process.

Thus, it can be difficult for large organizations to continue using Google Sheets for data visualization and analysis.

### #5. Few Integration Options

Another drawback of Google Sheets is its integrations with third-party platforms. 

Google Sheets works best within Google’s workspace - Google Docs, Google Drive, etc.

However, if you are already set up with other applications, you might notice it takes extra time and effort to transfer or export data to Google Sheets.

Till now, you might have understood how hard it is to [build a dashboard](https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-build-dashboard) on Google Sheets. Lucky for you, we have an easy, quick, and hassle-free solution for it.
