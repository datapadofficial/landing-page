What is an Operational Dashboard? What to Look for When Choosing an Operational Dashboard Tool? Datapad Geckoboard  Databox Dashthis  AgencyAnalytics Plecto  Klipfolio  Cyfe Dundas BI  Inetsoft Tableau  Wrap Up

_Disclaimer:_ The information below is accurate as of August 22, 2022.  

## What is an Operational Dashboard?

Operational dashboards help you track key performance indicators (KPIs) that tell you how every operation in your business is performing, be it sales, marketing, or recruiting.

Via an operational dashboard, a sales manager could know about the performance of every sales rep working under him and a marketing VP can know about the recent content strategy performance.

But that's not just it; tracking operational KPIs plays a pivotal role in increasing operational efficiency, thus improving overall business profitability.

One major question that the operational dashboard answers is - _**‚ÄúHow are the different ongoing processes in your business performing?‚Äù**_

Here‚Äôs an operational dashboard example:

Now that you‚Äôve understood what an operational dashboard tool is, you need to know how to choose the best one.

## What to Look for When Choosing an Operational Dashboard Tool?

Here are three basic things you should look for while choosing an operational dashboard tool:

### #1. Is It Easy for Your to Set It Up

Oftentimes, it becomes a tough job to set up dashboards on an operational dashboard tool because of its learning curve.

There will come a time, when you‚Äôll realize that you‚Äôre spending more time learning about the platform than tracking KPIs.

Choose an operational dashboard software that allows you to set up dashboards within minutes if not seconds.

### #2. Would It Give You Quick Access to Your Dashboards?

When you‚Äôre in a time-sensitive situation, you need an operational dashboard tool that lets you quickly open your dashboard, track KPIs, and talk to your team about it.

What if a KPI is out of its limits and needs immediate attention and you have to spend a significant amount of time just searching the dashboard that has the KPI you‚Äôre looking for.

Choose a software that has a search feature wherein you can type in the KPI‚Äôs name and get to it instantly.

### #3. Can You Have Access on the Go?

The best way to have access to your KPIs on the go is by choosing an operational dashboard software that has a mobile app where you can build, track, and analyze KPIs.

With this you can save time and increase productivity of both you and your team.

Our app - Datapad gives you instant access to your KPIs on the go. Our mobile app lets you create a dashboard in seconds, import metrics from multiple data sources and one-click integrations, and lets you onboard your team to track KPIs from anywhere in the world.
