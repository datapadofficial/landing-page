Polymer is modern AI data analysis and visualization software that helps you turn your data into fully customizable dashboards and slide-based presentations. 

Data analysis and analytical teams love using Polymer because of its modern AI features, ease of use, and sleek UI.

However, when you need a tool with multiple integrations and real-time data syncing, that’s when you must explore Polymer alternatives.

In this article, I will tell you why you should try an alternative to Polymer and discuss the best ones in the market.

## Why Do You Need a Polymer Alternative?

Here are the three primary reasons why people often look for an alternative to Polymer when it comes to data visualization:

- Limited integrations

- Not a team analytics platform

- Lacks real-time data syncing

Time to go deep into each of the reasons.

### Reason 1. Limited Integrations

Polymer lacks key integrations, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Instagram, Twitter Ads, and Stripe. It also doesn’t integrate with some data connectors for free. For example, adding Shopify as a data source is billed separately at $3 per month per store.

### Reason 2. Not a Team Analytics Platform

Polymer isn't ideal for teams. Although it allows adding collaborators, I can't annotate something or communicate with my team while staying on the dashboard. 

If I have to give suggestions on a particular metric or refer to some numbers, I'd have to use a third-party communication app. There’s no feature that helps you comment or communicate with your team in-app.

Secondly, Polymer's Basic to Pro plans only allow one editor, while the Team plan allows up to three. That's way less, considering the number of departments in your company that'd need access to analytics.

### Reason 3. Lacks Real-Time Data Syncing

Polymer doesn't feed your dashboards with live data from sources. It does allow scheduling a daily or hourly data syncing, but it's not real-time. 

Even with its most expensive plan, $250 per month, you get hourly data syncs while still paying for the Shopify connector (if added).

## What are the Best Polymer Alternatives and Competitors?

[Datapad](https://www.datapad.io/) makes tracking all your essential business metrics a piece of cake, all thanks to its ability to create stunning dashboards.

The software is easy to use, even for people not familiar with data analysis and visualization.

How does Datapad do it? It does so with the help of its 1-click templates and the feature of sharing performance reports with read-only links.

### Key Feature #1. Templates

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/m7rLbpP0wFAeaQMSOB7G5u9Kuis.png)

Creating reports for your business is a recurring, time-consuming, and comprehensive process. You have to analyze a bunch of metrics and KPIs and choose the ones you think might fit right into the reports you send to your clients, team members, or customers.

If you’re an agency and want to create the same reports for multiple clients, the process can soon become a nightmare for you.

But thanks to Datapad, you can do all this with just a few clicks.

With Datapad's template features, you can:

- Choose the right template from a pre-built gallery and apply them in 1-click 

- Build a custom dashboard and re-use it as a template by changing its sources

### ‍Key Feature #2. Team Collaboration

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/lfMtGJd62Mic0PYHmbTCMfmPDNY.png)

When you’re overwhelmed by which KPIs to track, you often end up making errors. So, in such scenarios, two heads are better than one. With Datapad, you can bring your team on board on a dashboard you’ve built, and they can then help you track KPIs better.

What’s more, individual team members are assigned tasks to handle, goals to achieve, and metrics to measure.

With Datapad's team collaboration feature, you can:

- Get notified whenever there’s an update for any metrics and KPIs you track

- Communicate around your metrics and KPIs with your team members

- Get push notifications on your phone to stay updated with all your KPIs
