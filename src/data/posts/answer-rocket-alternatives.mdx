Some of the best Answer Rocket alternatives on the market are Datapad, Datadog, Zoho Analytics, Yellowfin, MicroStrategy, Metabase, Klipfolio, AgencyAnalytics, Plecto, and Swydo.

In this article, I will discuss why you need an alternative to Answer Rocket and what the top ones are ‚Äì their features, pricing, pros, and cons.

## Why Do You Need An Alternative to Answer Rocket?

Upon initially engaging with Answer Rocket, I saw it as a powerful AI data analytics solution. However, I later noticed some drawbacks and limitations:

- The output and insights highly depend on your prompt quality

- Heavily relies on AI, with little customization options

- Limited features for advanced data analysis

### Reason 1. Output Highly Depends on Prompt Quality

Answer Rocket primarily functions on an AI-powered Q\&A interface. It allows you to deploy conversational AI assistants that understand plain text queries to help with crucial analytics tasks and reasoning.

**However:** 

_"Eighty-nine percent of machine learning (ML) engineers who work with generative AI say their_[_&#x20;models show signs of hallucination_](https://www.aporia.com/survey-2023/)_, according to survey results published Wednesday from ML observability platform Aporia."_

That's a whole lot of delusional computing. 

And since Answer Rocket relies on your prompts for outputs, it can be seriously tricky out there. The phrasing for the query must be well-constructed to get accurate results. It consumes time and requires multiple trial-and-error attempts.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/pNZpmrIqHhHGSdjY9szbGQjFjU.png)

### Reason 2. Lacks Customization Options

The conversational AI interface needs to be more flexible in terms of what users can customize within the platform. 

At the most, you can create personalized AI assistants with the ability to generate outputs and visualizations based on user preferences, which are remembered for future queries. But the granularity, like changing graph colors and layouts, is inaccessible.

### Reason 3. Hard to Master

With Answer Rocket, a lot depends on how you train AI models to fit your business requirements. 

That is, you must have the technical know-how to train and tune everything from language, insights, visualizations, presentations, and more for your AI modeling to provide relevant, actionable outputs.
