If you search for Domo’s pricing, you might get little to no information about it. That’s because Domo isn’t quite transparent about what it charges for the different tier plans it offers.

In such cases, it’s often hard to make a purchase decision, right? I feel you. I have faced the same issues in the past, and that’s why I’ve come up with a guide that has all the information about Domo’s pricing.

However, after reading the guide, if you feel that Domo isn’t the right fit for your business, we also have an alternative for you, which is an easy-to-use BI and data visualization tool.

Let’s start by knowing a little bit about what Domo has to offer.

## Domo Pricing Plans

Domo offers a 4-tier pricing model which caters to businesses from small startups to large enterprises.

The platform's credit usage-based approach ensures that you only pay for the resources you utilize. This means no more hefty upfront costs or restrictive contracts.

Here are the Pricing Plans:

- **Free Trial:&#x20;**&#x4C;ets you try out Domo for 30 days. Fully featured with unlimited users.

- **Standard:&#x20;**&#x50;erfect for teams with lower data volumes. Fully featured, unlimited number of users.

- **Enterprise:&#x20;**&#x42;uilt for organizations with higher data volumes and who prefer additional dedicated support.

- **Business Critical:&#x20;**&#x46;or organizations requiring additional layers of security, scale, and volume.

The tiered pricing model offers flexibility for businesses of varying sizes. But it's essential to look into the nuances of its pricing structure before choosing Domo.

## Domo Pricing Factors to Consider

Domo’s pricing is simple but not so simple. Let me tell you what this means.

There are four things to consider:

- **Data Volume:**  The amount of data you ingest and process within Domo will directly impact your costs. Larger datasets and more complex data operations will consume more credits.

- **Credits:**  You buy a pool of credits up front, and as your team uses Domo's features, those credits get used up.

- **Features:**  The specific features you utilize will also influence your pricing. Advanced analytics, data governance, and machine learning capabilities are typically included in higher-tier plans.

- **Add-ons:**  Add-ons like dedicated support and professional training are priced separately.

The pricing page says that the number of users accessing Domo will not affect your costs, meaning that you can have unlimited users using your account. 

But what it doesn’t clearly say is more users will use more credits, and you will end up purchasing extra credits before your monthly credits refresh.

### How are Credits in Domo Used?

- **Storing Data:**  The amount of data you bring into Domo affects your credits. Bigger datasets require more credits to store and manage.

- **Crunching Numbers:**  Complex data analysis and calculations use more credits than simple tasks.

- **Advanced Features:**  Using features like data governance or machine learning costs more credits than basic reporting and visualization.

Domo has different credit categories depending on how you store your data.

It's a bit technical, but basically, some credits are for specific ways Domo holds onto your data. Don't worry too much about the details for now – just remember the more data you store and the more complex things you do with it, the more credits you'll use.

Domo provides tools to monitor your credit usage so you can see how much you're spending and avoid any surprises.

Let’s now talk about the plans it offers.

## Is Domo Expensive?

Domo is frequently voted 4 and above out of 5 stars on review websites from the enterprise accounts on G2 and Capterra in terms of pricing. So I don’t think there’s a problem with big organizations facing any problems affording Domo.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/10Tm8cnSgJdUWGEjBlUkOvU7oAI.png)

It might be helpful to assess your specific needs and budget to see if Domo aligns with your requirements.

- Domo can be expensive compared to other data analytics platforms.

- Some users find the cost to be a significant portion of their company's budget.

- Others believe the value Domo offers outweighs the cost.

Domo's pricing structure can be particularly challenging for small businesses with their limited budgets.

The credit consumption-based model leads to unexpectedly high costs. Especially if there’s a large volume of data you need to analyze monthly.

Similarly, organizations that handle large datasets frequently may face escalating expenses as their data processing and storage requirements increase.

We recommend carefully evaluating your data analytics needs and budget before making a decision.

## How Much Does Domo Actually Cost?

There are no fixed prices listed on Domo's website, so it is difficult to say exactly how much it will cost. You will have to contact Domo’s sales team to get a quote that matches your requirements.

However, I did some digging and found some information related to Domo’s pricing.

The actual cost depends on the volume of data you process, the frequency of that processing, and any additional services you require. 

The base user fee starts at $750 per user per year, as per an online review. Here is the [full discussion thread](https://www.peerspot.com/questions/what-is-your-experience-regarding-pricing-and-costs-for-domo) on Peersport.

Domo’s pricing is flexible but can get complicated. It costs differently depending on your industry as well. 

Here’s a [Domo Pricing Proposal](https://assets.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-12/documents/717034/651642342375109-pricing-document-2020-07-17-1521.pdf?ref=holistics.io) you can look at.

Depending on the usage, you can expect Domo to cost you upwards of $20,000 for mid-sized companies and $50,000 per year or higher for enterprise customers.

## Wrapping Up

Let’s face it; you can’t simply say if Domo is expensive or not. It really depends on how much you are willing to invest in data analysis and visualization.

But it's one of the top players in its category and offers great features like embedded analytics, workflow automation, governance and security, and more.

However, I think it’s not very transparent when it comes to pricing, and the consumption-based pricing model makes it expensive.

Datapad, on the other hand, has a free plan to test the waters, no hidden charges and all plans and pricing are listed on the website.

If you or your team are looking for an affordable and flexible BI and visualization solution, sign up for [Datapad](https://app.datapad.io/welcome?_gl=1*fgqhrx*_ga*MzI5NTg0MzUyLjE3MjA3NjM0MjM.*_ga_HW8FZP24PQ*MTcyMDc2MzQyMy4xLjAuMTcyMDc2MzQyMy4wLjAuMA..), import your KPIs, and create stunning dashboards for you and your team.
