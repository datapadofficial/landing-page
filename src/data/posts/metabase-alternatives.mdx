Some of the best Metabase alternatives for flawless KPI dashboard creation are Datapad, Looker, Microsoft Power BI, Domo, Grafana, Redash, Holistics, Swydo, and Cluvio.

In this guide, you will find a full comparison between these Metabase alternatives and know which one’s right for your business.

## Why Might You Look for Metabase Alternatives?

### Reason #1. Scarcity of Features

Although Metabase has an interactive user interface, it lacks some key features to entice users. Such as, the platform lacks drag-and-drop functionality, a feature that can be easily found on any dashboarding platform.

![Metabase review #1](https://framerusercontent.com/images/TQKcuDXfVK6v0sfOejkveDDzqU.png)

Moreover, the graphs and reports are repetitive and limited, which leaves you with just a handful of data visualization elements.

### Reason #2. Steep Learning Curve

When it comes to the learning trajectory, Metabase’s learning curve is steep, like the Alps. It can take a while before you and your team can master the platform's functionalities.  

![Metabase review #2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/3UOJhoHs5Xm3Ivlnume2QA7bE8Y.png)

Besides, it can be tricky for a person to create dashboards or datasets with no experience in SQL.

### Reason #3. Slow Load Time and Has Some Bugs

Metabase suffers during team collaboration. In many cases, it slows down when multiple business users are accessing the dashboard.

![Metabase review #3](https://framerusercontent.com/images/L8XXo7pxWFLi8HYOOR0HE6vQdc.png)

Not only during collaboration but in general, the results load way slowly.

Now that you know why you need to switch from Metabase to another dashboard software let's look at some of the choices you've got.

## What Are the Best Alternatives to Metabase?

1. **Datapad: Track KPIs via mobile on the go**

2. **Looker: Tracking marketing-related KPIs**

3. **Microsoft Power BI: Best for larger teams**

4. **Domo: Comes with numerous integrations**

5. **Grafana: Stunning pre-built templates**

6. **Redash: Best for coders**

7. **Holistics: Flawless drag-and-drop builder**

8. **Swydo: Best for sharing dashboards with your team**

9. **Cluvio: Best for enterprise**

## #1. [Datapad](https://www.datapad.io/)

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png)

[Datapad](https://www.datapad.io/) helps you track all essential [metrics ](https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics)from stunning dashboards.

### Key Feature #1. Templates

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/m7rLbpP0wFAeaQMSOB7G5u9Kuis.png)

Creating reports for your business is no easy task. You have to determine a lot, from which metrics to choose to design the right charts.

If you are an agency and want to create the same reports for multiple clients, then this hassle becomes even more burdensome.

Guess what? Datapad lets you do all this with just a few clicks.

With Datapad's templating features, you can:

- Choose from a gallery of pre-designed templates and apply them with 1-click

- Build a custom dashboard and re-use it as a template by changing it's sources

- Share all connected data sources in the workspace with your teammates

### ‍Key Feature #2. Team Collaboration

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/lfMtGJd62Mic0PYHmbTCMfmPDNY.png)

Tracking KPIs isn't a one-person job when you have a lot of them; you need a team. But not all KPI dashboard tools let you bring your team on board. 

Guess what? Datapad lets you do it quickly and easily. 

Moreover, you can assign individual team members tasks to handle, goals to achieve, and metrics to measure.

With Datapad's team collaboration feature, you can:

- Get notified whenever there’s an update for any metrics and KPIs you track

- Communicate around your metrics and KPIs with your team members

With our [dashboard software](https://www.datapad.io/blog/dashboard-software-for-small-business), you can subscribe to any dashboard and receive daily email updates.

All you have to do is build a dashboard, click the subscribe button, and set your email preferences.

The best part is you can share reports with anyone, even emails outside of your organization or workspace.

#### Step 1: Subscribe to a dashboard

#### Step 2: Check your inbox

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/iTtKlXCFWIhxL9GYHa6e0cqiEek.png)

With Datapad’s report and scorecard automation, you can:

### Pricing

We are now offering an earlybird discount to all users, so it's a great time to [sign up and give Datapad a spin](https://app.datapad.io/).

### 3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Use Datapad?

#### #1. If You Want to Do a Deep Analysis and Not Have a Quick Overview of Your Data

Datapad is meant for founders and managers who just want to keep an eye on all the KPIs and not dig further. In case there’s something off, they can ask their team to take care of it.

If you’re an individual tracking all the KPIs in-depth and want to know why each KPI is performing the way it is, we’d suggest you go ahead with Metabase or some other KPI dashboarding tool.

But if you just want a managerial view of your KPIs fast and frequently, Datapad will prove to be a great choice.

#### #2. You Don't Want to Have a Mobile-Only Experience

If you're a desktop-ridden person, our tool isn't the right choice. Our tool does not support desktop dashboarding (it's something being worked upon). Besides, Datapad has an amazing mobile version that has all the features you expect from a desktop-dashboarding tool.

#### #3. You Need a Lot of Integrations

We’re being honest here! If you are the owner of a large organization or someone who needs tons of integrations to extract data from multiple data points, Datapad will limit your needs.

Although we are consistently working on adding more and more integrations to our platform, as of now, it’s limited to some popular integrations.

Maybe down the line, Datapad would be an excellent choice for sourcing data from multiple data sources, but for now, it isn't.

### Pros and Cons
