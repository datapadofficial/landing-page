## What is E-commerce Analytics?

In the world of savvy shoppers, ecommerce analytics refers to any tool or strategy designed to extract actionable insights from a large pile of data. Because ecommerce in itself is a virtual space, every activity performed by clients or customers is accumulated in the form of data.

**FACT:**  More data was created in 2021 than what was created during the previous 5000 years. For obvious reasons!

But unfortunately, in the same amount of time, the average cart abandonment rate is rising day by day.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/PM8A7SrUv3w4XlbLr6bo2oGgCeo.png)

[Source](https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment#1)

That means at least seven out of ten shoppers won’t complete their transaction. Here’s where ecommerce analytics can help.

Ecommerce analytics can offer valuable insights into your clients' shopping behavior and the customer journey, from discovery to customer acquisition.

## Why Do You Need E-commerce Analytics?

With the evolution in consumer demand, the ecommerce market is set for record sales. 

According to Statista, the number of online shoppers is expected to reach 2.14 billion in 2021, up from 1.66 billion global digital buyers in 2016.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/WRWAVQoRQ6u5tepBkPj51wtbBI.png)

[Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/251666/number-of-digital-buyers-worldwide/)

So, there's a boom, there's a pool of buyers, but there isn't a proper system to measure and analyze the trends pulling in or waving off your customers. Or is there?

Indeed there is!

E-commerce analytics helps you make good data-driven decisions by providing you with customer behavioral insights. 

It allows you to:

- Guide your customers through the marketing funnel smoothly and efficiently by using the insights about their online behavior

- Make better product recommendations by analyzing your customer’s activities and behavior across your website

- Segment your target market based on demographics and characteristics to personalize your products and services, thereby running effective ads

- Understand what channels drive the most traffic and make your marketing strategy revolving around those metrics

- Improve customer retention rate by analyzing data and running better retargeting ads

- Identify your top customers to build better relationships with them 

Now that you know the basics of ecommerce analytics let's look at the top analytics tools you can try to track metrics and KPIs the right way.
