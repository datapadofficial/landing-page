## Why Might You Look for Google Data Studio Alternatives?

### Reason #1. Report Creation Takes Too Long 

Although you get several pre-built report templates, they're all not perfect for copy-pasting purposes. You often need to spend a lot of time customizing the report as per your requirements.

For the most part, data collection and visualization get more challenging as you scale up with Google Data Studio. You start encountering frequent delays in updating sources and lags in refreshing and stacking data.

![G2 review google data studio](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Vtnyl9Hrmh3e3jKE7btPigp4l5A.png)

Even though you have already spent enough time figuring out the perfect bars and graphs to represent your data, these additional delays might waste your time.

### Reason #2. Lack of Real-Time Updates

Real-time updation of data is also an issue with Google Data Studio. We came across several complaints from data researchers about how long it takes to obtain data that is 100% accurate.

![G2 review google data studio](https://framerusercontent.com/images/EGoxbq6C3Zt7FOsIfGGqf7DMfVY.png)

Although the platform is backed by plugins to combat the issue, when it comes to creating up-to-date reports, the user interface is something you would still dislike.

Similarly, Google Data Studio lags when using real-time data and report connections as queries get more complicated and lengthy. 

### Reason #3. Limited Customization Options

Google Data Studio isn't a suitable solution for large agencies and organizations with large clientele and several KPIs to track. You may ask why.

![G2 review google data studio](https://framerusercontent.com/images/pZ53SXnXcjc4uyLJntP9KDfhr9E.png)

Data Studio limits you with the number of charting options you can use for data visualizations. You must know that with Google Data Studio, you're limited to as low as 50 components and data points per page. 

Although the platform provides an interactive user experience, advanced users may find the customization features lacking compared to other business intelligence and data visualization tools.

### Reason #4. Lack of APIs and Integrations

Lastly, among the weaknesses mentioned above, the lack of APIs for automation and the limited data sources is something that you will crave when using Google Data Studio.

In today's hyper-competitive business environment, automation is a sought-after feature for any tool, irrespective of its functions and purpose. 

For example, top-performing agencies often need ad-hoc data delivered daily or at least weekly, in addition to monthly or quarterly reports.

While that's possible using manual processes in Google Data Studio, the absence of any way to reliably employ agency automation (without employing workarounds) can quickly throw a wrench in your reporting workflows. 

When talking about integrations, there's no doubt that Google Data Studio provides seamless integrations within Google's ecosystem. However, the same becomes complicated when you want to source data from a third-party application.

![G2 review google data studio](https://framerusercontent.com/images/mwanBnHHjGHuBkCxUhB4iHgP6JE.png)

The lack of native integrations to popular data sources like HubSpot or Salesforce might turn out to be a problem for users.

### How Does Datapad Compare to Google Data Studio?

Comparatively, both platforms are free to use. However, Google Data Studio comes with a steep learning curve for novice users. Datapad, on the other hand, is an easy-to-use tool with a fantastic user interface.

When it comes to automation and customization flexibility, again, Google Data Studio lacks behind in many ways. Here're a few other reasons why Datapad can be a better alternative to Google Data Studio.

### 3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Use Google Data Studio

#### #1. If You Want to Do a Deep Data Analysis and Not Have a Quick Overview of Your Data

With Google Data Studio, you can't drill down data as much as you can with Datapad or any other KPI dashboarding tool.

Although it’s a free tool, you need some depth to analyze KPIs and make data-driven decisions.

It’s crucial because your company’s growth depends on results that come out of KPI tracking.

#### #2. You Don't Want to Have a Mobile-Only Experience 

Mobile phones, being your closest family member, helps you in every possible way. And you expect your dashboarding tools to be mobile-friendly, right?

Unfortunately, Google Data Studio canvas doesn't have a responsive design. This means your dashboard won't fit your mobile screens.

And even if it does (miracles happen, you know), you are bound to stare at this because editing an unresponsive dashboard would be a headache. 

#### #3. You Need Several Integrations

Google Data Studio isn't a great choice if you're a large organization with a lot of data to monitor for different layers and departments. 

Although the platform is well-integrated into Google's ecosystem, sourcing data from an external source is time-consuming. 

Plus, the tool lacks integrations to some popular platforms like HubSpot and Salesforce. 

## #2. Looker
