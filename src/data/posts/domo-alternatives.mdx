Domo is a data experience platform that comes with features like AI-driven insights, intuitive dashboards, and real-time data integration. These features help you with decision-making and automate business processes.

However, when it comes to analyzing large datasets, visualization capabilities, and affordability, Domo falls short.

In this article, I will tell you why you should try an alternative to Domo and discuss the best ones in the market.

## Why Do You Need a Domo Alternative?

Although Domo is a popular tool for dealing with numbers, users often look for alternatives to Domo for one of the following reasons:

- Performance issues with large datasets

- Lacks visualization capabilities

- High, unaffordable pricing for SMBs

Let's have a closer look at these.

### Reason 1. Reliance on Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Causes Performance Issues with Large Datasets

For those unaware, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) allows data to be transformed on a separate processing server before transferring it to the data warehouse.

Domo's [Magic ETL](https://www.domo.com/data-integration/etl) allows users to build out complex transformations with an intuitive drag-and-drop toolkit. However, ETL is an older method ideal for complex transformations of smaller data sets.

If you've terabytes of data, Domo will struggle with data cleaning and preparations, leaving you on your own.  

### Reason 2. Limited Visualization Capabilities

Although you will find all basic visualization options like charts, graphs, and tables, there are no advanced visualization elements for complex datasets. Also, there’s little customization you can do with default visualizations.

### Reason 3. Lacks Data Management

Some users found it hard to understand data paths and how they link with different datasets. It would help to see the schema like in other software such as Sisense or Salesforce.

On top of that, users feared renaming a field in a dataset would cause issues and might even break everything that was built. Users desired better tables and pivot tables with basic Excel functionality.
