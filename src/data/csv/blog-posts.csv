You scramble to pull up three different dashboards, ping your data team, and promise to circle back ""within the next few days."" Sound familiar? You're not alone.</p><p>Product managers across industries face the same frustrating reality: <strong>dependency on data teams has become the biggest bottleneck in product analytics.</strong> Traditional analytics processes force PMs to wait days or weeks for basic insights, severely limiting agility and responsiveness to market changes.</p><p>But here's the thing – tracking product metrics doesn't have to be this painful. The right approach to product analytics can transform how you understand user behavior, optimize product performance, and drive business growth.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/4COa1I0QpP2cJOcyy6OviLcG0.png""><h2>What is Product Analytics and Why It Matters More Than Ever</h2><p>Product analytics is the practice of collecting, analyzing, and acting on data about how users interact with your product. It's not just about tracking numbers – it's about understanding the complete user journey, from first touch to loyal customer.</p><p><strong>The stakes have never been higher.</strong> With increasing competition and rising customer acquisition costs, product managers need instant access to actionable insights. According to recent industry reports, companies that leverage AI-powered product analytics see 23% faster decision-making and 31% improvement in product KPIs.</p><p>Product analytics serves multiple critical functions:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Understanding user behavior patterns</strong> to optimize the product experience</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Identifying bottlenecks</strong> in the user journey that impact conversion</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Predicting churn</strong> before it happens and taking proactive measures</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Measuring feature adoption</strong> to guide product roadmap decisions</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Calculating ROI</strong> on product investments and improvements</p></li></ul><h2>Essential Product Metrics Every PM Should Track</h2><p>The key to effective product analytics isn't tracking everything – it's tracking the right things. Here are the product metrics that actually move the needle:</p><h3>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h3><p><strong>What it measures:</strong> The average cost to acquire a new customer across all marketing and sales channels.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> CAC directly impacts your bottom line and helps you understand the efficiency of your growth efforts. A rising CAC without corresponding increases in customer lifetime value signals trouble ahead.</p><p><strong>How to calculate:</strong> Total acquisition costs ÷ Number of new customers acquired</p><p><strong>Industry benchmark:</strong> Varies by sector, but SaaS companies typically aim for a CAC payback period of 12-18 months.</p><h3>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)</h3><p><strong>What it measures:</strong> The total revenue you can expect from a customer throughout their entire relationship with your product.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> CLV helps you understand how much you can invest in customer acquisition while maintaining profitability. It's also crucial for identifying your most valuable customer segments.</p><p><strong>How to calculate:</strong> Average revenue per customer × Average customer lifespan</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Focus on the CLV:CAC ratio – a healthy ratio is typically 3:1 or higher.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/qW0xTPWhoTQQPly3lPJRPGQuHf8.png""><h3>Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)</h3><p><strong>What it measures:</strong> Predictable revenue generated from subscriptions on a monthly or annual basis.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MRR and ARR provide clarity on business growth trajectory and help with financial forecasting. They're especially critical for subscription-based products.</p><p><strong>How to calculate:</strong> Number of customers × Average revenue per customer per month/year</p><h3>Churn Rate</h3><p><strong>What it measures:</strong> The percentage of customers who stop using your product during a specific time period.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Churn rate is often the most important metric for product health. High churn indicates fundamental product-market fit issues, while low churn suggests strong product value.</p><p><strong>How to calculate:</strong> (Customers lost during period ÷ Total customers at start of period) × 100</p><p><strong>Industry insight:</strong> Best-in-class SaaS companies maintain annual churn rates below 10%.</p><h3>Activation Rate</h3><p><strong>What it measures:</strong> The percentage of new users who complete key actions that indicate successful product adoption.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Activation rate is a leading indicator of long-term customer success. Users who don't activate are highly likely to churn.</p><p><strong>How to calculate:</strong> (Users who completed activation events ÷ Total new users) × 100</p><p><strong>Critical consideration:</strong> Define your activation event carefully – it should represent genuine value delivery, not just feature usage.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/KvQYYuy1BQZQpSXb9PFJJfTFKY.png""><h2>AI-Powered Product Analytics: The Game Changer</h2><p>The biggest shift in product analytics isn't just about what metrics to track – it's about how you access and act on those insights. AI-powered product analytics tools are transforming how product managers work with data.</p><p><strong>Traditional product analytics process:</strong></p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Identify question</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Request data from analytics team</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Wait 3-5 days for response</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Receive static report</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Ask follow-up questions</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Repeat cycle</p></li></ol><p><strong>AI-powered analytics process:</strong></p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Ask question in plain English</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get instant insights with visualizations</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Drill down with conversational queries</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Receive proactive alerts about changes</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Share insights instantly with stakeholders</p></li></ol><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/cdQAb5L7gln3tatpstqDiOow8w.png""><h3>The Power of Conversational Analytics</h3><p>Instead of learning complex dashboard interfaces, product managers can now simply ask: ""How did our activation rate change after the onboarding redesign?"" or ""Which customer segments have the highest churn risk?""</p><p>This conversational approach to product analytics eliminates the technical barriers that have historically slowed down product decision-making. Tools like Datapad's AI analyst can connect to your existing data sources – Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, PostgreSQL, MongoDB – and provide instant answers to complex product questions.</p><h2>Best Practices for Product Analytics Implementation</h2><h3>Focus on Your North Star Metrics</h3><p>The most successful product teams identify 2-3 key metrics that directly correlate with business success. These ""North Star"" metrics should:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Align with your company's strategic objectives</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Be measurable and actionable</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Reflect genuine user value</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Be understandable across the organization</p></li></ul><h3>Implement Cohort Analysis</h3><p>Cohort analysis allows you to track how different groups of users behave over time. This is particularly powerful for understanding:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How product changes impact user behavior</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Which acquisition channels provide the highest-quality users</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How customer behavior evolves with product maturity</p></li></ul><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/JC7nZ6tAGw1MhqJNAVXEULrhs.png""><h3>Set Up Automated Alerts</h3><p>Rather than checking dashboards constantly, set up intelligent alerts that notify you when important metrics move outside expected ranges. This proactive approach ensures you catch issues early and capitalize on positive trends quickly.</p><h3>Regular Metric Reviews and Adjustments</h3><p>Product analytics isn't a ""set it and forget it"" process. Schedule regular reviews to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Assess whether your current metrics still align with business goals</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Identify new metrics that have become important</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Eliminate vanity metrics that don't drive decisions</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Adjust benchmarks based on market changes</p></li></ul><h2>Common Product Analytics Pitfalls to Avoid</h2><h3>The Vanity Metrics Trap</h3><p>Vanity metrics like total page views, app downloads, or registered users can make you feel good but don't necessarily indicate product success. Instead, focus on metrics that predict business outcomes.</p><p><strong>Replace vanity metrics with actionable ones:</strong></p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Instead of ""total users,"" track ""active users""</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Instead of ""feature usage,"" track ""feature adoption depth""</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Instead of ""email opens,"" track ""email-driven conversions""</p></li></ul><h3>Over-Reliance on Lagging Indicators</h3><p>While metrics like revenue and churn are important, they're lagging indicators. Balance these with leading indicators like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Product engagement scores</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Feature adoption rates</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customer satisfaction surveys</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Support ticket volume</p></li></ul><h3>Analysis Paralysis</h3><p>Having access to massive amounts of data can be overwhelming. Combat analysis paralysis by:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Starting with your most critical business questions</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Focusing on metrics that directly inform decisions</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Using AI-powered tools to surface the most important insights</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Creating regular reporting cadences</p></li></ul><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0lqmWaIs5Q9iCaEOEsZEHPPg.png""><h2>The Future of Product Analytics: Autonomous AI Agents</h2><p>The next evolution in product analytics is already here: autonomous AI agents that don't just answer your questions but proactively monitor your product metrics and surface insights you wouldn't have thought to look for.</p><p>These AI agents can:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Detect anomalies</strong> in user behavior before they become problems</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Predict churn</strong> with higher accuracy than traditional models</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Recommend product improvements</strong> based on usage patterns</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Automatically generate reports</strong> for stakeholders</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Integrate external context</strong> like market trends and competitor actions</p></li></ul><p>For product managers, this means shifting from reactive data analysis to proactive product optimization.

Yet, many organizations still find themselves shackled to <strong>traditional data analysis methods</strong>, which often come with steep learning curves, high costs, and time-consuming processes. Enter AI agents: these AI-powered <em>heroes</em> promise not only to keep pace with the data deluge but transform it into actionable insights with unprecedented speed and accuracy. So, how does this brave new world look compared to its more traditional counterpart? 🤔</p><h3>Quick Summary</h3><p>This post will examine the evolution of <strong>data analysis via AI agents</strong> compared to traditional methods, exploring how cutting-edge technologies are rewriting the rules. We'll dig into the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and spotlight how platforms like <a href=""https://datapad.io"">Datapad.io</a> are pioneering the next-gen data revolution by making analytics more accessible and actionable than ever before.</p><h2>Traditional Data Analysis: A Time-Tested Approach?</h2><h3>The Classic Methods</h3><p>Traditional data analysis relies heavily on specialized tools and statistical techniques, such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and data mining. While robust, these methods can be time-consuming, often requiring significant manpower and expertise.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Reports Generation</strong>: Manually generated reports need constant updating.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Data Processing</strong>: Spreadsheets galore—complicated formulas and manual entry dominate.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Expert Dependency</strong>: Insights rely on human analysis and decisions.</p></li></ul><p>These processes, although reliable in their time, often result in <em>static insights</em> that can quickly become outdated in today’s fast-paced business environment.</p><p><strong>The main drawbacks?</strong> High costs, slow execution, and potential human errors. As businesses strive for agility and real-time decision-making, the need for a shift has become apparent.</p><h3>The Pain Points</h3><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Time Constraints</strong>: Companies lose valuable time combing through mountains of data manually.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Resource Intensive</strong>: Requires data specialists and dedicated personnel.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Reactive Insight</strong>: Traditional methods often answer ""what happened?"" rather than ""what's happening?""</p></li></ol><h2>AI Agents: The Dawn of a New Era</h2><h3>Introducing AI into Data Analysis</h3><p>AI agents are like the keen-eyed detectives of the data world, analyzing information at lightning speed and delivering insights with minimal human intervention. Unlike their traditional counterparts, AI agents can evolve and adapt with the datasets, continuously learning and enhancing their capabilities.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Autonomous Functionality</strong>: They make sense of complex datasets independently.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Proactive Insights</strong>: Not just understanding past data but identifying potential future trends.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Scalability and Speed</strong>: Process and interpret data faster and at a larger scale than ever before. 🍰</p></li></ul><h3>Key Advantages</h3><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Reduces the need for a large team of analysts.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Real-Time Analysis</strong>: Updates and dashboards are constantly refreshed.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: No need for deep technical expertise—AI agents are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.</p></li></ol><p><strong>How does this impact businesses?</strong> By significantly reducing the time to insight and democratizing access to data analysis, empowering decision-makers at all levels.</p><h2>The Showdown: AI Agents vs. Traditional Methods</h2><h3>Exploring Use Cases</h3><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Scenario 1: Retail Analytics</strong>         </p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Traditional</strong>: Analysts take weeks to compile sales data and customer feedback, offering insights after the fact.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>AI Agents</strong>: Analyze customer behavior in real-time, predicting trends and adjusting strategies on the fly.</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Scenario 2: Financial Forecasting</strong>         </p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Traditional</strong>: Monthly financial reports drawn from various sources, combined manually.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>AI Agents</strong>: Provide dynamic financial insights that adjust with market conditions instantly.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>The Verdict</h3><p>Can both methods coexist?

Poor Automated Reporting</h3><p>A vital component of any marketing reporting tool is a user-friendly interface. However, Agency Analytics fails to provide it.</p><p>We came across reviews of the reporting interface being limited, clunky, and challenging to be worked upon.&nbsp;</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/AiXbFDMpXAgdyUtEiTS3aEbaqw.png""><p>Besides a steep learning curve due to its poor interface, Agency Analytics also fails to provide not-so-user-friendly reports, which means that the cover pages of reports are unattractive.&nbsp;</p><p>And, you can’t simply do anything to enhance it because of the limitations in customization options.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/8IUKJHH4eCvZ6iMiknxBBm7kqA.png""><p>Moreover, you can’t present insights on a live report. We mean that even if you add insights to a report template, you can’t show live data on the report.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/YC1zEIYqs43OvQYuZ5ZwwJXhYv0.png""><h3>#2. Unfavorable Pricing</h3><p>Agency Analytics revolves around a ‘per campaign basis’ pricing model.</p><p>For example, the starter plan, best for freelancers, is priced at $10/month/client campaign. The said price is accessible with a minimum purchase of 5 client campaigns.</p><p>While the agency plan is priced at $15/month/client campaign, with a minimum purchase of 10 client campaigns.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/SfgMA301xzQQbbfk2nWKrikcdM.png""><p>Overall, the pricing is not as competitive as we expect it to be. The per-client model pricing can burn a hole in your pocket if you want to scale from 1 to 100 clients.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DqZ3LtRA1C8uBQlCxa2d6gCMRk.png""><h3>#3. Lack of Personalization Options</h3><p>Another reason to opt for Agency Analytics alternatives is the lack of white-labeling options.</p><p>The platform comes with a single white-label logo option, which isn't what many customers expect.</p><p>For the most part of it, personalizing your reports and marketing dashboards for your customers can be a great deal. But unfortunately, Agency Analytics doesn't stand at par with the expectations.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XlVVnsdbb1bVyaVamjfCzycHyuM.png""><p>Now that you know why you need an Agency Analytics alternative, it’s time to explore your options.</p><h2>9 Agency Analytics Alternatives You Must Try This Year</h2><h2>#1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> helps you track all essential <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">metrics </a>from stunning dashboards.</p><p>The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use.

Why? That’s because these tools are transforming how organizations function by making the team more lean, improving productivity across the organization, and getting you more ROI.</p><p>Using AI smartly can help you streamline workflow, automate recurring tasks, and make your team lean and more efficient.</p><p>In this article, we discuss the top 9 AI tools you can use for your business. You can use any one of them, or you can use them all for different departments of your business.</p><h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing an AI Tool for Business</h2><p>Here are the top 4 factors that you must consider when choosing any AI software for your business.</p><h3>1. Relevance</h3><p>The market offers AI tools for different use cases, such as content creation, process automation, data analysis, custom relationship management, and project management. Consider which area of your business requires AI assistance. Then, look for AI tools that fulfill those requirements.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Easy-of-Use</h3><p>New tools involve a fair learning curve. The same is true when you invest in an AI tool for business. A lot goes on behind the scenes, rather than just paying for the subscription costs.</p><p>Introducing a new tool to your team may backfire, especially if your team believes in traditional business methodologies. And not everyone is comfortable or acquainted with using AI.</p><p>To make it less intrusive and more inclusive, choose a tool with a user-friendly interface that involves easy navigation and click-and-done functions. Also, see if the software has enough self-help guides, documentation, and customer support in case of a bottleneck.</p><h3>3. Customizable and Scalable&nbsp;</h3><p>Look for AI tools that can be trained and tailored to fit your marketing strategies and objectives. Tools like Datapad, Canva, HubSpot, and Trello offer easy customization and flexibility to scale as your business grows.</p><h3>4. Cost-Effectiveness</h3><p>Unless you're surplus on revenue, every investment must deliver a heavy ROI. A quick discussion with key stakeholders and team members is also needed before deciding.&nbsp;</p><p>Decide on a budget for the tool and check for hidden costs. Consider tools with team plans rather than per-user pricing. Generally, annual plans are offered at discounted rates and might best suit long-term use in your business.&nbsp;</p><h2>9 Best AI Tools for Business</h2><h3>1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is the world's easiest AI-powered data solution for teams that helps you visualize crucial business KPIs and metrics via stunning dashboards and reports.&nbsp;</p><p>It has a user-friendly interface, allowing you to drag and drop widgets, visuals, and connectors to create impressive dashboards within minutes.

Of course not! 🙄</p><p>To do proper data analysis, you need to collect, clean, validate, format, analyze, and transform data the right way.</p><p>Businesses use data analysis to track all important KPIs, spot trends, and increase business efficiency.</p><p>In this article, we will walk you through all the essential steps you need to take when analyzing data and list tools that'd help you in data analysis.</p><h2>What is Data Analysis?</h2><img alt=""what is data analysis"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FDFNN6N2Tm9XCMGLQqKWLydPQQ0.png""><p>Data analysis is the process of clearing, formatting, validating, and analyzing data to make data-driven decisions.</p><p>No matter what market sector you’re in or what kind of target audience you serve, at some point in time, data analysis will be the most important thing for your business.</p><p>According to a <a href=""https://www.sigmacomputing.com/blog/top-data-analytics-trends-statistics-for-2022/"">survey conducted by Sigma</a>, 63% of companies think that data analysis increases their work efficiency and 57% of companies think data analysis helps them make better business decisions.</p><p>The primary purpose of data analysis is to analyze a ton of data, squeeze the most useful information out, and put it in front of you and your team to make crucial business decisions.</p><p>When we talk about data analysis in business, the best example we can give is tracking KPIs. If you own a website, there's a very high chance you might look at your <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-google-analytics"">Google Analytics kpis</a> and Google Search Console accounts daily or weekly.</p><p>You do that to monitor traffic, impressions, CTR, session time, and whatnot. If you see something’s wrong, you <strong>‘analyze’</strong> it further by drilling down the data you have.</p><p>This is what data analysis is.</p><p>And then, when you’re sure about the reason behind it, you make a <strong>‘data-driven’</strong> decision and try fixing the issue.</p><p>But you might be wondering, why is data analysis so important? 🤔</p><p><strong>Short answer: </strong>It’s important for your business growth.</p><p>Let's consider you own a website, and its monthly traffic is declining month-over-month. You can't just ignore the fact that you're losing traffic because website traffic is directly proportional to the customer you get over time.</p><p>To get to the root of the problem, you will have to analyze target audience data, visitor behavior, demographics, and many more data sets and make a calculated decision.</p><p>Now that you know the basics of data analysis let's take a deep dive into how to analyze data for any business.</p><h2>How to Analyze Data Thoroughly?</h2><h3>Step #1: Define Measurable Goals</h3><img alt=""define measurable goals"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/u3Bs3k980paicx7PIaMQGsncck.png""><p>Before jumping in and analyzing or even collecting raw data, have clear goals for data analysis.</p><p>Business goals help you keep aligned toward a specific objective and track data more efficiently.</p><p>When setting goals, they will vary according to the team you're setting them for, the data collected, and your role in the company.</p><p>There are different teams in a company, and different teams will have different goals:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>A marketing team would set a goal of improving organic traffic and making new partnerships</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>A finance team might look to reduce cash burn rate and discover new cost-saving methods</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The sales team might set a goal of booking more meetings next month&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The product design team might look to add new features to the product and impress customers</p></li></ul><p>But did you notice one thing in all the above 4 points? The goals mentioned aren’t measurable.</p><p>Get this; when setting goals, try having goals that you and your team can measure. This helps you know how your business is performing.</p><p>The above-mentioned examples can be converted into measurable goals by being specific:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Marketing Team Goal:</strong> Increase organic website traffic by 40% and make 5 new partnerships in Q3 2022</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Finance Team Goal: </strong>Reduce cash-burn rate by 20% and discover 3 new methods to save money</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Sales Team Goal: </strong>Book 20 new meetings next month&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Product Design Team Goal:</strong> Add 5 new features to the product in Q3 2022</p></li></ul><p>These goals will help you and your business know what data to collect, tools to use, and in decision-making.</p><h3>Step #2: Collect Data From All the Sources</h3><img alt=""collect data from sources"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Xe43lt78PAqaWYgZaquqfInDfY.png""><p>Now that you’ve set measurable goals, it’s time to collect data from all the sources you can.</p><p>When collecting data, ensure that you collect both quantitative data and qualitative data.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Quantitative Data:</strong> Data that you can measure and tweak, for example, a bar graph</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Qualitative Data: </strong>Unstructured data that needs structuring before data mining, for example, reviews or videos&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>In most cases, quantitative data is stored in databases like Excel, Google Sheets, Airtable, etc. This data can be easily imported into any tool you use for data analysis.</p><p>But qualitative data isn't so easy to collect and import. Unlike quantitative data, qualitative data is stored in cloud servers of multiple tools that you might use.</p><p>And most importantly, the majority of qualitative data is text-based; that’s not as easy as measuring and analyzing quantitative values.</p><p>Here are a few examples of what we mean by qualitative data:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customer emails</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customer reviews</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Support tickets raised by customers</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Social media comments and other data</p></li></ul><p>And many more…</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Data collection is crucial because your business goals will all be aligned with them. So take time and make sure you collect both qualitative and quantitative data from all known sources.</p><h3>Step #3: Decide Upon Which Data Analysis Methods to Use</h3><img alt=""which data analysis method to use"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ogcOSFp8UPvU2M7FhaHjLAk2JQ.png""><p>There are six major types of data analysis processes. Let’s look at them one by one.</p><h4>#1. Text Analysis&nbsp;</h4><p>Data is not just a random string of numbers; it's sometimes text as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Text analysis uses natural language processing (NPL) and machine learning (ML) to convert human language into language that a machine can understand.</p><p>The tools used in this process can sort text in accordance with the topics, extract keywords, and read the emotion in the text to give you the intent.</p><p>Text analysis is best to answer the question of what is happening and the reason behind it. It's majorly used in businesses that want to analyze customer feedback via reviews, emails, or social media comments.</p><h4>#2. Descriptive Analysis</h4><p>Descriptive analysis gives you the answer to exactly <strong>‘What happened’</strong> to a specific data set when analyzing it.</p><p>It's one of the most basic types of analysis, to begin with. You can calculate the mean, median, mode, percentage, frequency, etc, with descriptive analysis.</p><p>Although it's a very powerful method, descriptive analysis has numbers and therefore can't explain to you the reason behind why you see these specific numbers.</p><h4>#3. Inferential Analysis</h4><p>Inferential analysis is the most important analysis process when tracking KPIs for business.</p><p>It compares a group of data with historical data and tells you what’s actually happened and the reason behind a KPI’s fall or rise.</p><p>So if you have a huge database of all the customers who've bought your product, with the inferential analysis, you can analyze small datasets like repeat customers, customers according to demographics, customers who bought your product via mobile, etc.</p><p>This data analysis process is widely used in market research campaigns. A perfect example of this would be a fashion brand trying to figure out the money spent by female vs. male customers.</p><h4>#4. Diagnostic Analysis</h4><p>Diagnostic analysis is also known as root cause analysis. As the name suggests, this analysis helps answer the question - Why did it happen?</p><p>The process extracts insightful data from the dataset and tries to understand why a KPI crashed or increased a hundred folds.</p><p>Patterns and deviations are the two elements diagnostic analysis uses to identify reasons.</p><p>The best use of such analysis is to study your customers' behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>If you see a sudden spike in customer complaints or see a significant increase in sales via mobile phones, diagnostic analysis is the key to all your questions.</p><h4>#5. Predictive Analysis</h4><p>Predictive analysis takes existing data into consideration and predicts what might happen to a certain metric in the future.</p><p>There are a lot of 'ifs and buts' when doing predictive analysis, and that's because no one has seen the future (have you 😉).</p><p>The best use of predictive analysis is when you track sales KPIs. Based on the demographic, customer salary, age, etc, you can predict how good your business will do in a certain location.</p><h3>Step #4: Clean and Validate Your Data</h3><img alt=""clean and validate data "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/KJ5PszbkDYcBmqChPZuZYGRr7Nc.png""><p>After you’ve collected data from several data sources, there will be some errors and inaccuracies that might need corrections. Data cleaning is a practice that aids you with it.</p><p>Here are some tips for cleaning your data thoroughly:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Add a title to all the rows and columns, so it's easily understandable</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Remove duplicate rows and columns from your data to avoid confusion</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Delete all the entries that you might not use when doing data analysis and creating KPI dashboards</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Ensure that the font size, color, and type are the same throughout for consistency</p></li></ul><p>After clearing data, you can move on to validating your business related data further.</p><p>Data validation is the process of eliminating the entry of unwanted data in your dataset.</p><p>With no proper validation, measuring KPIs could be a nightmare for you. It's not just time-consuming, but it will also result in incorrect values and waste time.</p><p>If you’re just starting your business and have a small data set to track, we’d suggest you use Google Sheets to validate your data. The process is manual but doesn’t take much time.</p><p>Here’s how to do it:</p><p><a href=""https://assets.website-files.com/62010c298ad50e2f90f75c5f/6315a2843c58962c238fe079_GIF-7-Data-Validation.gif"">https://assets.website-files.com/62010c298ad50e2f90f75c5f/6315a2843c58962c238fe079_GIF-7-Data-Validation.gif</a>&nbsp;</p><p>But if you have a large dataset that’s tough to clean manually, you can use a data cleaning tool like <a href=""https://dataladder.com/"">Data Ladder</a> to clean data automatically.</p><h3>Step #5: Conditionally Format Your Data for Easy Access</h3><p>After thoroughly cleaning your data, it's time to format it to increase user-friendliness.</p><p>Conditional formatting is all about setting limits and color scheming data in order to divide a large data set into multiple smaller groups.</p><p>This technique is handy for businesses who want to sort or divide their data by demographics, age, gender, etc.</p><img alt=""sheets conditional formatting "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lB5ZrH8CoXMU4GJ43XJU3qI3Aqs.png""><h3>Step #6: Start Data Analysis and Look for Patterns and Trends</h3><img alt=""data pattern analysis "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DzYWr6OUr7cT22LCKpaR22dcixE.png""><p>When analyzing data, spotting trends is a crucial part as it will tell you where you’re going wrong.</p><p>For numerical data, spotting trends and patterns is easy, but if you have more qualitative data than quantitative data, you might have to drill deep to spot trends.</p><p>But remember one thing; trends and patterns aren't always right. Try not to rely so much on the correlation between any two trends.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you see a huge spike in your YouTube subscription rate and at the same time there are a lot of sales calls booked, don't assume both these things are related.&nbsp;</p><p>They might be, or they might not be!</p><p>Do a proper data analysis before drawing such conclusions.</p><h3>Step #7: Compare Your Data with Historical Data</h3><p>Comparing present data with historical data is an underrated yet impactful technique when doing data analysis.</p><p>You won’t be able to find any trends or patterns for your current data set if you look at it in isolation.&nbsp;</p><p>Comparing your data with historical data gives you an idea of what needs to be changed in your current strategy so that it's in line with your trend.&nbsp;</p><p>Or it might also give you an idea to break the trend (if it’s good for your business).</p><p>But it’s not always possible to compare your data with historical data. What if you’re just getting started with your product and have no historical data to refer to?</p><p>When such situations arise, industrial benchmarks can come to your rescue.</p><p>You can compare your product data with similar company benchmarks and see where you stand.</p><img alt=""check historical data"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RJfSLN9xcti4QHRgMwwD97GesU.png""><p>But bear in mind that it's not easy to find a company that's very similar to yours (same size, same revenue, same number of customers, etc.), so use their data as a reference point and compare accordingly.</p><h3>Step #8: Share Data with Your Team</h3><img alt=""share data with your team "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PUBF7AlLNK8mZDLqg3EncBT2d0.png""><p>When you're expanding your business to new horizons, tracking KPIs isn't a one-person job.&nbsp;</p><p>With so many different KPIs for various departments in your company, you’d spend your whole day analyzing data, tracking KPIs, and finding solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, hiring a team of experts for each department in your company and persuading them to track KPIs is a better idea, don’t you think?</p><p>A KPI dashboarding tool like <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> (<em>disclaimer: this is our tool</em>) helps you onboard your team in seconds. Onboard your team, assign them the department-specific KPIs, and talk to them about these KPIs in real-time via the comment section inside the app.</p><h3>Step #9: Analyze Data That’s Not In Line with Your Goals</h3><img alt=""analyze data "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/IzBkyaibzbRe33SJqcXfPOZXVfs.png""><p>Remember the first step of this step-by-step data analysis process? It was to set measurable goals.&nbsp;</p><p>The trends, patterns, and datasets that aren’t in line with your set goals might need attention. You can’t just let things fall into place and expect everything will be good.</p><p>Taking action against data that's not in line with your goals is the only thing that will make your business more efficient and, thus, more profitable.</p><p>After analyzing data and spotting irregularities, look for the reason behind the rise of fall of a certain dataset. If you think there can be multiple reasons for it, start testing and experimenting and look at what works.</p><h3>Step #10: Visualize Data the Right Way</h3><p>From Step 1 to Step 9 - everything was about data analysis. But, in order to read the data appropriately, you need a proper data visualization tool.</p><p>A KPI dashboarding software helps you convert the raw data into stunning visual graphs and charts, puts them on a dashboard, and lets you track all the KPI-related data with ease.&nbsp;</p><img alt=""datapad data visualization "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/EuEoq3B8ymx6aExbUrDq4wMyI.png""><p>With a KPI tracking tool, you can onboard your team, set goals, get notifications about your KPIs, and import data from multiple sources.</p><p>So now that you know all the steps you should take to analyze the data, it’s time to look at some data analysis tool that’d take things to the next level.</p><h2>What are the Best Data Analysis Tools?</h2><h2>#1.

However, I later noticed some drawbacks and limitations:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The output and insights highly depend on your prompt quality</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Heavily relies on AI, with little customization options</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Limited features for advanced data analysis</p></li></ul><h3>Reason 1. Output Highly Depends on Prompt Quality</h3><p>Answer Rocket primarily functions on an AI-powered Q&amp;A interface. It allows you to deploy conversational AI assistants that understand plain text queries to help with crucial analytics tasks and reasoning.</p><p><strong>However:</strong></p><p><em>""Eighty-nine percent of machine learning (ML) engineers who work with generative AI say their</em><a href=""https://www.aporia.com/survey-2023/""><em> models show signs of hallucination</em></a><em>, according to survey results published Wednesday from ML observability platform Aporia.""</em></p><p>That's a whole lot of delusional computing.&nbsp;</p><p>And since Answer Rocket relies on your prompts for outputs, it can be seriously tricky out there. The phrasing for the query must be well-constructed to get accurate results. It consumes time and requires multiple trial-and-error attempts.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pNZpmrIqHhHGSdjY9szbGQjFjU.png""><h3>Reason 2. Lacks Customization Options</h3><p>The conversational AI interface needs to be more flexible in terms of what users can customize within the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>At the most, you can create personalized AI assistants with the ability to generate outputs and visualizations based on user preferences, which are remembered for future queries. But the granularity, like changing graph colors and layouts, is inaccessible.</p><h3>Reason 3. Hard to Master</h3><p>With Answer Rocket, a lot depends on how you train AI models to fit your business requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>That is, you must have the technical know-how to train and tune everything from language, insights, visualizations, presentations, and more for your AI modeling to provide relevant, actionable outputs.</p><h2>What are the Best Answer Rocket Alternatives and Competitors?</h2><p>Some of the best alternatives to Answer Rocket are:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Datapad</strong>: Track all your essential business metrics with stunning dashboards.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Datadog</strong>: A comprehensive platform for data analysis and visualization.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Zoho</strong> <strong>Analytics</strong>: Offers AI-powered features to manage data efficiently.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Yellowfin</strong>: BI and analytics platform for creating interactive dashboards, visualizing data, and generating reports.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>MicroStrategy</strong>: Lets you create interactive dashboards and reports.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Metabase</strong>: Helps you analyze data fast.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Klipfolio</strong>: Cloud-based data visualization platform.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>AgencyAnalytics</strong>: Comprehensive reporting and marketing dashboard.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Plecto</strong>: Business performance platform designed to enhance organizational performance through real-time data visualization, gamification, and coaching tools.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Swydo</strong>: Automated marketing reporting and monitoring platform.</p></li></ul><h3>1.

Yeah, you read it right, Trillion with a T. But you can’t just expect to do some cold calls and earn millions.</p><p>Instead, you have a better chance by leveraging data to your benefit. B2B marketing KPIs allow you to refine tons of data into systematic and measurable formats and measure your business's marketing performance in terms of lead generation, revenue growth, and profitability.</p><p>So, in this article, we'll walk you through the purpose of B2B marketing KPIs, how they can lead your business, and the 12 most important KPIs every business owner should measure.</p><h2>What Are B2B Marketing KPIs?</h2><p>Marketing key performance indicators for B2B companies are quantifiable measurements used to gauge the company's marketing performance towards set goals and objectives.</p><p>Simply put, marketing KPIs tell you about how your campaigns are performing, the quality of your leads, and your content marketing strategy performance (if you have one, of course).</p><p>But not every marketer is smart enough to dig deep and track <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/marketing-kpis"">marketing KPIs</a> that impact their business. All they do is study the basic KPIs and make a dashboard around them. </p><p>Every business is different and runs different marketing campaigns. Therefore, the B2B marketing KPIs every business tracks might vary.</p><p>We will get to the KPIs part later; first let’s talk about their importance.</p><h2>Importance of B2B Marketing KPIs</h2><h3>#1. KPIs Help You with Planning and Decision Making</h3><p>You might be familiar with the term 'data-driven’ businesses. So, what's the fuss about it?</p><p>The business environment we live in is completely dependent on data - from marketing to sales - every neck of the woods requires data to taste success.</p><p>B2B marketing KPIs bring along the raw data, refine it, and present you with hidden insights that help you plan ahead of your competitors.</p><p>Besides, these metrics can help you forecast future trends, prevent mishaps, and make data-driven decisions.</p><h3>#2. They Assist In Budget Allocation</h3><p>With the perfect blend of B2B marketing metrics, you better understand which marketing campaigns are worth investing in and which need to be sacked.</p><p>You can use the insights derived from these KPIs to identify best-performing marketing campaigns and allocate budgets in those areas to scale your efforts. </p><h3>#3. They Help You Measure the ROI</h3><p>Keeping an eye on certain B2B marketing KPIs, such as ROI and ROAS, can help you quantify and prove your business’s true marketing success. </p><p>After all, every business owner puts in hard-earned money to get rewarded in terms of an increase in revenue, profitability, and growth.</p><p>Now that you know the what and why of B2B marketing KPIs, here are the 12 KPIs that can help you measure your business’s marketing performance.</p><h2>12 B2B Marketing KPIs Every Business Owner Should Measure</h2><h3>KPI #1. Website Traffic</h3><p>Website traffic is not a precise metric, i.e., it doesn't directly impact a company's financial health. However, from a marketing perspective, it's the foremost thing to track.</p><p>This KPI measures the number of visitors you get to your website via social channels, organic, or inorganic methods.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>It's obvious that all your marketing and SEO efforts are aligned toward consistent website traffic. Monitoring and analyzing the traffic is a good way to get answers to questions like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How do the customers land on your site?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What do they want from you? </p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What exactly are they interested in?</p></li></ul><p>Besides, your website visitors can be potential leads who can later transform into customers. You don't want to ignore the leads, do you?</p><p>The best way we figured out to measure this metric is via tools such as Google Search Console. Using GSC, you can count and monitor traffic easily and effectively.</p><img alt=""search console screenshot "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DezWflCXNaPCftCV5LnNrys0Tag.png""><h3>KPI #2. Click-Through Rate</h3><p>Click-through rate measures the percentage of impressions that resulted in a click. As a metric, CTR tells you how well the audience is resonating with your ads or any other marketing campaign you run.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The ultimate goal of CTR is to get qualified users to take some kind of action you expect them to (ex: signup, make a purchase, or fill out a form). </p><p>When running a PPC campaign, the click-through rate directly impacts your Ad rank and the quality score (keywords, ad copy, landing page).</p><p>If you have a:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>High CTR, users are finding your ad to be highly relevant</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Low CTR, users are finding your ad to be less relevant</p></li></ul><p>A lower CTR is often the result of the following:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Persuading the wrong target audience</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Unattractive ad design</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Poorly drafted ad copy</p></li></ul><p>Here's a simple formula to measure it:</p><img alt=""clickthrough rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/uedgW36KPGe9gmbM37SaqEFd6Q.png""><h3>KPI #3. MQL to SQL Conversion Rate</h3><p>Marketing Qualified Leads are leads that have shown interest in your product or service to be considered as qualified, But not enough interest to be a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL).</p><p>This KPI is of more relevance for B2B marketers than B2C because their sales cycles are longer, and purchasing decisions are rather complicated.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>MQLs are considered half-baked leads because they are less likely to convert. They may need more marketing content exposure and guidance to push them down the funnel as sales-qualified leads.</p><p>Measuring the number of marketing leads that finally convert into SQLs helps you identify how effective your marketing efforts are. Plus, it lets you measure the cost of acquiring a lead.</p><p>For example, users who downloaded your ebook or brochure or signed up for your newsletter are considered marketing-qualified leads. </p><p>A sales-qualified lead, on the other hand, is one that has visited your pricing page multiple times or filled up a contact form.</p><p>To calculate the rate at which your marketing leads positively convert into sales leads, use this formula:</p><img alt=""mil to sql conversion ratw"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RA0UyUxlti5GolIJkGeSBSquc2g.png""><h3>KPI #4. Lead to Close Conversion Rate</h3><p>While generating quality leads is one thing, converting them to customers is a whole another concept. Lead to close conversion rate is the percentage of leads that convert into actual customers.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>At the end of the day, what's the point of business if people don't buy from you?</p><p>Lead to close conversion rate KPI provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of marketing campaigns to convert potential leads into customers. As a result, allowing you to identify your top and worst-performing campaigns.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate it:</p><img alt=""lead to close conversion rate"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/rf9uXOKQitiD3JZnHCDgYohztbE.png""><h3>KPI #5. Bounce Rate</h3><p>Bounce rate refers to the number of times people visit your website but leave without navigating through or staying on your website.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Bounce rate is a critical metric to measure due to three reasons:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Bounces depict that you are getting visitors (leads) but are unsuccessful in converting them into customers</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Bounce rate plays a vital role in your website's SERP results; hence, the lower, the better</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Lastly, bounce rate also helps you find what’s wrong with your site (specific pages) in terms of content, user experience, or page layout</p></li></ul><p>The average bounce rate for B2B companies is <a href=""https://contentsquare.com/blog/2021-digital-experience-benchmarks-by-industry/"">75%</a>. Besides, the bounce rate also depends on the source of traffic. </p><p>For example, display ads and social media traffic tend to have a higher bounce rate than referrals and emails.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate it:</p><img alt=""bounce rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eMI2XGJcOKDB6M98rnmL3OvmgSk.png""><h3>KPI #6. Email Signups</h3><p>If one channel of your B2B marketing is email, it becomes extremely important to keep an eye on email signups.</p><p>Email Signups refer to the number of website visitors that sign up for your newsletter or any other email campaigns. </p><p>Although this seems like a simple metric, having a reliable email list can do wonders for your business.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The adoption rate of email marketing in B2B companies is around <a href=""https://www.circle-research.com/2012/its-all-about-the-lead/"">88%</a> because businesses still feel emails as the most reliable communication channel. And that's true!</p><p>Remember we said above that traffic generated from emails have the lowest bounce rates? </p><p>That's because emails are delivered directly to the audience who signed up for them. Therefore, making it highly likely to reach a qualified audience, unlike other marketing channels like social media that work on assumptions.</p><p>In the B2B context, email signups don't mean you need to pitch a new product or service every time (that's more accurate for B2C). </p><p>Here, you're offering highly specialized and intangible benefits to other businesses. Hence, leveraging your email list to communicate offers, updates, and information that can prove to be beneficial in earning trust and maintaining relationships.</p><p>Email signups can be simply counted if you're connected to any CRM; if not, you can count them manually.</p><h3>KPI #7. Customer Acquisition Cost [CAC]</h3><p>Customer Acquisition Cost, also known as cost per conversion, refers to the amount of money incurred in acquiring new customers.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>In the last five years, the CAC has soared by over <a href=""https://www.reforge.com/brief/content-marketing-cac"">50%</a>, giving a hard time to businesses in strategizing marketing budgets. Because if you don't leap, your competitors will.</p><p>This metric shows how effectively your B2B sales and marketing teams convert leads to customers while maintaining a lower CAC.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate CAC:</p><img alt=""cac formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PtEfN9v8xrLr972PVHS0Ds9w.jpeg""><p>Your business's financial health is alarming if your CAC exceeds the CLV (customer lifetime value). However, you can improve this by building adequate retention strategies and enhancing your marketing efforts.</p><h3>KPI #8. Customer Lifetime Value [CLV]</h3><p>Another significant B2B marketing KPI is the customer lifetime value. This KPI measures the amount of revenue generated by individual customers during their relationship with the business.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Tracking a customer's lifetime value answers three vital questions:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How much profit each customer generated for the business?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How much can you spend on acquiring customers?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Which segment or demographics of customers is generating higher revenue?</p></li></ul><p>You can use these insights to create ideal customer personas and work towards a better marketing strategy for them.</p><p>Here’s how you can calculate CLV:</p><img alt=""CLV formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eIQg2oqRhzaSI9o7ipuBcxOMps.png""><p><strong>Note: </strong>The higher the CLV, the greater the profit and the more loyal customers you have with your business.</p><h3>KPI #9. Monthly Recurring Revenue [MRR]</h3><p>This KPI measures the predictable revenue that it expects to generate every month from its subscription model or direct sales.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>MRR is a granular metric that focuses on the short-term aspects of a company's finances.</p><p>Being calculated every month, MMR helps you identify hidden insights such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The rate at which people opt for monthly subscriptions</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Revenue generated from active subscriptions</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How much are customers willing to pay every month?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How much does an ideal customer spend monthly on your products or services?</p></li></ul><p>Getting answers to these questions allows you to identify strategies to increase recurring revenue. </p><p>Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA) is a crucial metric for calculating MRR. You can calculate it by taking the average revenue generated and dividing it by the total number of customers that month. And then, you can put that value in the MRR formula, that is:</p><img alt=""MRR formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7DTtFpRNlAOGmhtKPdaGnjhRqEQ.jpeg""><h3>KPI #10. Marketing ROI</h3><p>When you invest a boatload of money in marketing, you want a positive return, right? May it be in terms of profits, leads, customers, or quality improvement. </p><p>Marketing ROI exactly measures that. This KPI specifically measures the return on investment from the marketing. Simply put, it compares the amount of money you spend on marketing to the amount you gain from it.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Firstly, determining marketing ROI is important because it keeps you motivated. And secondly, your ROI from each marketing campaign allows you to identify what's making you money and what's not.</p><p>This helps you invest money in profitable campaigns and double down on what's working.</p><p>Besides, ROI is a nail-biting metric for stakeholders. It's the only one they want to see increasing, keeping aside your efforts. </p><p>No wonder why marketing teams are so overwhelmed tracking this KPI.</p><p>For example, if one dollar spent on marketing brought five dollars in sales, the ratio is 5:1. This ratio is considered good, but; anything below 2:1 is not profitable. </p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate marketing ROI:</p><img alt=""Marketing ROI formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RMpYs0QQ3I3i0282959kI1SgQ.png""><h3>KPI #11. Return on Ad Spend [ROAS]</h3><p>The digital B2B ad spending in the United States accounts for $8.68 Bn. </p><img alt=""Return on ad spend formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/9018dWIFIDAAWQp51AqX6j4.png""><p><a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/1059672/b2b-digital-ad-spend-usa/"">Source</a></p><p>This 10-figure value is enough to tell you why this is an important metric for a B2B company.</p><p>ROAS measures the amount of revenue your business earns against each dollar spent on advertising.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Although ROAS and ROI sound similar, they are Walter White and Heisenberg.</p><p>Marketing ROI is a comprehensive metric that measures the profitability of overall marketing efforts. It may include other operating expenses such as tools, remunerations, etc.</p><p>ROAS, however, is specific to the return from ad spending. It lets you figure out which ad campaigns are most and least successful; and if running ads is even worth the cost.</p><p>These insights can help you continuously refine your spending to generate the most revenue for the least cost.</p><p>Here's a quick formula to calculate ROAS:</p><img alt=""ROAS formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/3qbIAebo64Dg9tIcNzV3JnQg7pc.png""><h3>KPI #12. Cost-Per-Click</h3><p>Cost-per-click is yet another metric to measure the effectiveness of your online campaign. </p><p>This KPI measures the number of visitors directed to your website after clicking on a published advertisement. Basically, it's an internet advertising model where an advertiser pays the publisher for the number of times an ad is clicked.</p><p>So, the number of visitors you get to your website via ads incurs a certain cost, termed cost-per-click.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This metric helps you understand how well people resonate with your ads. If your ad has minimal clicks, there's something wrong with it. </p><p>Moreover, CPC is also relevant when measuring your ROI from ad spending.</p><p>Here's a pretty simple formula to calculate CPC:</p><img alt=""cpc formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PVpNqVIS57SB07FOog8BHp3zvo.png""><h2>How to Create A B2B Marketing KPI Dashboard in Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad homepage"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1VxHe826IlNXy81ZyI1TeuYps.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a modern-day dashboard creation tool that allows hustling entrepreneurs to track, monitor, and analyze business performance from their mobile phones.</p><p>Unlike traditional desktop dashboarding, our tool's feature-rich interface allows anyone to track KPIs from anywhere around the world on their mobile phones.

Ease of Use and Adaptability</h3><p>Look for AI data analysis tools that are easy to use and navigate, even for non-technical users. A user-friendly design significantly reduces the learning curve for your team.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, ensure the software offers self-help resources and doesn't require extensive training sessions or dev ops guidance to master the tool's workings.</p><h3>2. Model Management and Updates</h3><p>AI models require regular updates and constant learning to maintain accuracy and relevance. Especially as your business data changes over time, it's crucial that the chosen software supports model updates and version control, allowing you to adapt to new data trends and requirements without significant downtime or manual intervention.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Analytical Accuracy and Speed</h3><p>AI can indeed hallucinate. We have seen it with ChatGPT and other AI models, too. Therefore, you must vouch for the tool's analytical accuracy and response time.&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to test the tool's accuracy and reliability is to use the free trial. You can also skim through user reviews to understand any inaccuracies or flaws users have experienced using the platform.&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Scalability and Performance</h3><p>As your data grows, the selected tool should be able to scale accordingly. Evaluate the tool's performance with large datasets and its ability to handle increased workloads without compromising speed or accuracy.&nbsp;</p><p>Scalability is essential for future-proofing your data analysis capabilities as business needs evolve.</p><h3>5. Automation and Analytical Capabilities</h3><p>Look for AI data analysis tools with robust automation and analytical capabilities. They must automate monotonous processes such as data collection, harmonization, and preparation for analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, ensure the tool can handle different data formats and analyses, like descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, or prescriptive – based on your business needs.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Are The 10 Best AI Tools for Business?</h2><h3>1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> offers a powerful solution for tracking essential metrics through visually appealing dashboards.

Your Data Needs</h3><p>Identify whether you work with structured, unstructured, numerical, textual, or spatial data. Different tools have varying capabilities in handling different data types.</p><p>Next, assess the size and complexity of your datasets. And whether it requires advanced visualization capabilities like heatmaps, sunbursts, or dot plot charts.</p><h3>2. Rich Visualization Options</h3><p>Ensure that the tool has a diverse range of visualization elements – charts, graphs, tables, maps, and more, that align with your data analysis needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Look for the level of customization and interactivity in visualization. For example, can you click to drill down on the visual? Or can you customize visual elements (colors, labels, interactivity)?&nbsp;</p><h3>3. The Level of AI Integration</h3><p>AI tools can integrate AI into the platform at various levels. Some offer AI as a layover, allowing you to interact with your data. Others integrate it deep within the platform to help create AI dashboards and reports and perform ad-hoc analysis.</p><h3>4. Connectivity with Other Apps and Data Sources</h3><p>Integration with your existing tech stack and data sources is a must. Look for tools with plug-and-play integrations to popular data sources for easy data import. This will save you time and the hassle of looking for another tool to connect multiple data sources with your tool.</p><h2>9 Best AI Tools for Data Visualization</h2><p>Here’s a list of the best AI tools for data visualization 👇</p><h3>1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eqPtfJ3kge5ensTqWIpzwyycPxY.png""><p>Datapad is an all-in-one data visualization and reporting platform.

You don't have to go back to the lengthy process of manual data entry into Excel (that's one job less).</p><div><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/no-facepalm-excel-dBTGeHJ3aIvtJDe4VV"">via GIPHY</a></div><p>Moreover, these software emphasizes using visual aids like charts, graphs, heatmaps, tables, timelines, and other data visualization elements to demonstrate your marketing efforts effectively.</p><p>Besides, a typical marketing dashboard is a treasure-trove of KPIs and metrics; some of the most popular ones include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Website traffic [SEO or Inorganic]</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Click-through rate [For email marketing, social media marketing, and more]</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Bounce rate</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Conversion rate [PPC campaigns, newsletter conversion, etc.]</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Return on advertisements [ROAS]</p></li></ul><p>And many more…</p><p>Apart from these core skills, an excellent marketing dashboard software must adhere to some other qualities, or what we may term <em>Soft Skills</em>.</p><p>Coming to the main part, choosing a marketing dashboard software is a process in itself, and here are some factors to consider when doing it.</p><h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best Marketing Dashboard Tool</h2><h3>#1. Is It Easy for You to Set Up?</h3><p>For starters, an easy setup gives you a head-start and the confidence to utilize any software to its max potential.&nbsp;</p><div><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/latenightseth-boom-3o7btNa0RUYa5E7iiQ"">via GIPHY</a></div><p>A lot goes on before you can process insights, like connecting to data points, onboarding the team, assigning authorities, and more.</p><p>And so, before picking a software, check for its setup reviews and support quality - these two things will give you an idea of what you’re dealing with in terms of CX.</p><p>In fact, some SaaS companies offer 10 to 15 mins software setup time, which is not bad. But since there are a lot of KPI dashboard software options in the market, you should always aim for the best.</p><h3>#2. Would It Give You Quick Access to Your Dashboards?</h3><p>Imagine sitting and staring at your dashboard that’s buffering forever…</p><div><br></div><p>With such a loading speed, it would take you hours just to track a single KPI, let alone multiple marketing dashboards.</p><p>Therefore, instead of testing your anxiety levels, ensure that the software is highly responsive.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking of responsiveness, it's a common problem among desktop-ridden dashboards requiring multiple sign-in, more screen time, and lousy loading time.&nbsp;</p><p>Check if the software has a mobile version, allowing you to access your marketing dashboard from anywhere and anytime.</p><h3>#3. Beautiful Dashboards</h3><p>Although it might sound a little off at the start, a better-looking dashboard makes your marketing efforts look better. It's human physiology; things that look better are better.</p><p>Several agency marketers consider this an important factor when choosing marketing dashboard tools.</p><p>By beautiful dashboards, we don't really mean adding creatives into them. A beautiful dashboard can be minimalistic, neat, and simple; the right blend of colors and elements makes your dashboard easily navigational for the eyes.</p><p>Moreover, everyone wants to impress clients with better-looking dashboards. So choose a marketing dashboard software that’s visually appealing.</p><p>Enough about the factors; let's look at some of the best marketing dashboard software out there in the market.</p><h2>What Are the Best Marketing Dashboard Software?</h2><h2>#1.

Limited Integrations</h3><p>When building reports and tracking KPIs, integrations play a key role. Any software you use must integrate with multiple sources to give you a chance to track each and every KPI essential for your business.</p><p>When I looked at the integrations Calliper offers, I felt that it’s missing integrations from the e-commerce and email marketing sectors.

It's a matter of time before a frustrated customer switches to your competitor. </p><p>They are just a google search away! </p><h2>What are Customer Experience KPIs?</h2><p>Customer experience KPIs are quantifiable measurements that help you identify your customers' loyalty or satisfaction. </p><p>Basically, it measures the level of interaction between a company and its customers.</p><p>By tracking these key performance indicators, you can calculate how fast you lose customers, how effectively you retain them, their lifetime value, and their overall experience with your business.</p><h2>Importance of Measuring KPIs For Customer Experience</h2><h3>#1. Determining Customer Loyalty Rate</h3><p>Loyal customers are the ones who are more likely to continue purchasing from your business. They don't owe you anything, so why do they do so? </p><p>It’s because of the <strong>‘customer experience.’</strong></p><p><a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-acquisition-study?__hstc=238111519.18fb3160a9ec5a277e5c471fca8c2734.1666367977220.1666367977220.1666367977220.1&amp;__hssc=238111519.1.1666367977221&amp;__hsfp=3158525640"">93% of customers</a> are likely to repeat purchases with brands that offer excellent customer experience. Not only this, but they are also willing to spend 5X times more on your products.</p><p>Customer experience KPIs help you track various metrics, such as Net Promoter Score (NPS) and customer lifetime value, to determine and identify your loyal customer base and estimate future sales performance.</p><h3>#2. Identifying Areas of Improvement</h3><p>Businesses can use these KPIs to identify the lagging and leading areas of customer experience. </p><p>To do so, you can monitor customer service procedures and sales service. This way, you can figure out whether your employee's knowledge gap or high customer expectations are making you lose customers.</p><p>Likewise, if a customer encounters a poor experience with your support team, you can also identify the cause behind it and modify your service protocol to ensure optimum customer satisfaction.</p><h3>#3. Keeping Performance Aligned with the Objectives</h3><p>Every business has its set goals and objectives. In the same context, the customer experience provided by the brand might also have some pre-defined expectations. Right?</p><p>For example, if a retail store sets an objective to increase customer satisfaction by 25% in 3 months, it can use various customer experience KPIs to measure the staff's progress in reaching that goal.</p><p>Businesses commonly use KPIs such as CSAT, bounce rate, and more to measure objectives that improve customer experience. </p><p>Let's now dive deeper into consumer experience KPIs and explore the 11 most important KPIs to track.</p><h2>11 Customer Experience KPIs Every Business Owner Should Track</h2><h3>KPI #1. Net Promoter Score [NPS]</h3><p>Let's start with the most common metric for measuring customer experience. Net Promoter Score (NPS) refers to the number of customers who are willing to recommend your product or service to their network. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The first thing that strikes our mind is word-of-mouth marketing. A good net promoter means people are highly likely to recommend your product, and hence, more people get exposure to your brand.</p><p>Secondly, and surprisingly, the metric is not uncommon among most Fortune500 companies, including Apple, Airbnb, and more. So, how do we measure it?</p><p>NPS is typically measured with surveys that ask customers whether they'd recommend a company's products to a friend or colleague. Typically, these surveys have a scale from 0 to 10. </p><p>To ease the measurement, we can categorize the scores into three kinds of voters:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Detractors:</strong> People who vote between 0-5</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Passives:</strong> People who use your product but won’t be recommending it to anyone, 6-7</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Promoters:</strong> People who vote above 7</p></li></ul><p>To calculate your final NPS, use this equation:</p><img alt=""NPS formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XommhBKlVFPhgvRX6HDWeraYA.jpeg""><p><strong>Note:</strong> NPS might tell you the numbers but doesn't answer the 'Why' for both parties. Apart from the survey question, you can add your personalized question to get better-informed data.</p><h3>KPI #2. Customer Satisfaction Score [CSAT]</h3><p>CSAT, with a mix of NPS, is a popular combination every business owner must track.</p><p>CSAT is a comprehensive KPI that allows you to gather up-to-date customer feedback after using your product or service. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This KPI is commonly used in Google or Facebook review systems. Unlike net promoter score, CSAT can be for a specific product or service and can have many forms and scales.</p><p>The CSAT survey is taken immediately after a customer has made a purchase.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Under-promising and over-delivering can lead to a positive customer satisfaction score.</p><p>In fact, most companies boast about their excellent CSAT on their website to attract more customers.</p><p>Evidently, a high CSAT demonstrates a customer-centric culture and also caters to an improved retention rate. Now, to measure customer satisfaction score, ask customers to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of: </p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Very satisfied</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Satisfied</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Not Satisfied</p></li></ul><p>And then, divide the number of satisfied respondents by the total number of respondents.</p><img alt=""CSAT formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pG8qPpmARAKq1afUlR802ps95fM.jpeg""><h3>KPI #3. Customer Retention Rate [CRR]</h3><p>Where NPS and CSAT give you a brief understanding of your retention efforts, customer retention rate specifically tells you where your retention efforts stand.</p><p>Customer retention rate, or CRR, measures the number of returning customers during a specific time period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p><a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/state-of-service-inside-customer-service-trends/"">80%</a> of customers say that a company's experience is as important as its product or services. No wonder your retention rate is a prolific indicator of the overall customer experience.</p><p>Besides, the probability of selling to an existing customer is more than a new customer, while acquiring a new customer costs you 7X more.</p><p>In one way or another, retained customers are more beneficial for your business. </p><p>CRR is also directly related to customer churn rate. You see, a higher retention rate depicts that less number of customers are leaving your business, leading to a lower churn rate.</p><p>To determine your customer retention rate, you just need three numbers:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customers at the start of a given period</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customers at the end of that period</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>New customers acquired during that period</p></li></ul><img alt=""CRR formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wDWBgFuOydPsfIaRFD1eJASh7Q.jpeg""><p>Here,</p><p>E refers to the number of customers at the end of a period.</p><p>N is the number of new customers gained during the same period.</p><p>And S is the number of customers at the beginning of the period.</p><p>For example, if you have 100 customers at the beginning of the month, and you lose 20 customers but gain 40 more during the month. Your CCR equals to:</p><p>{(120 - 40) / 100} X 100 = 80%</p><h3>KPI #4. Customer Churn Rate</h3><p>Customer churn rate measures how quickly customers leave or cancel their service subscription within a given period. Simply put, it measures the number of customers lost by your business during a specific period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Commonly measured as a percentage, churn rate is a critical metric to measure when it comes to customer experience. You may ask why?</p><p>The reason why people stop interacting with your business are directly or indirectly related to your overall customer experience. A low churn rate indicates that customers are satisfied with your services, while a high churn rate goes the other way around.</p><p>Moreover, when you combine churn rate insights with operational insights, you can identify areas that lag behind expected customer experience and can build strategies to improve the same.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the customer churn rate:</p><img alt=""customer churn formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/kAn2xZbLyksHvCQBJ2a9hGc3zA.png""><h3>KPI #5. Customer Effort Score [CES]</h3><p>Customer effort score measures the amount of effort required by a customer to complete an activity with your company. The action can be anything like looking for a product, making a purchase, or resolving a ticket.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Your customer effort score is directly interlinked with the churn rate. You see, the more efforts customers require to interact with you, the more frustrated they get, and the more chances are of them being churned.</p><p><a href=""https://inmoment.com/xi-terms/customer-effort-score/"">94% of customers</a> are likely to make a purchase when they have an effortless experience with your brand.</p><p>It's just how freely and quickly things work for them!</p><p>Like NPS, the CES is also measured using a survey that asks customers questions about their engagement with the business. The survey can use a rating scale from 1 to 7.</p><p>Here, anything greater than 4 indicates an effortless customer experience. </p><p>Now, to calculate CES as a percentage, use the below formula:</p><img alt=""customer effort score formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ze47dyg8b5pJ0hKMAQYAb0kxWD4.png""><h3>KPI #6. Customer Lifetime Value [CLV]</h3><p>Customer lifetime value is a crucial metric to track as part of the customer experience program. It refers to the amount of revenue a customer generates during his relationship with the business. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>We may count CLV as a predictive metric, as it predicts the net profit obtained from a customer during the entire future relationship. </p><p>Factually, CLV goes hand in hand with certain KPIs such as acquisition cost, retention rate, and churn rate. Here's how they are related:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>If CLV is more than acquisition costs, you are running high on profits</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>A high CLV demonstrates a promising retention strategy in place</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>While a low CLV accounts for an increase in customer churn rate</p></li></ul><p>Besides, CLV is a great metric to use when you deal with a multi-year relationship with a customer – say, for a subscription-based service.</p><p>You can use the insights to forecast future revenue and identify pain points where customers stop using your services, thereby building better retention strategies.</p><p>Here's how you can measure CLV:</p><img alt=""CLV formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/w3yzJZ8UB7DEsPof88PIJjv3rQ.jpeg""><h3>KPI #7. Cart Abandonment Rate</h3><p>Cart abandonment rate refers to the number of times people added products to their cart but didn't complete the purchase.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The average cart abandonment rate worldwide is just below <a href=""https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate"">70%.</a> That means 70% of visitors add a product to their cart but don’t complete the transaction.</p><p>They simply switch from making a purchase to ghosting you. Frustrating, isn't it?</p><p>This also costs brands approx <a href=""https://www.dynamicyield.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment-ebook-announcement/"">$18 Bn</a> annually. So even if you slightly improve your customer experience, you can earn a significant portion of the value.</p><p>However, many ways exist to improve customers' shopping experience and decrease cart abandonment rates. Here're a few:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Optimize your checkout process to increase conversion</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Avoid adding hidden costs, and be transparent with your customers</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Don't force customers to create an account until necessary</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Make available all the popular modes of payments during checkout</p></li></ul><p>Here's how you can calculate the cart abandonment rate:</p><img alt=""Cart Abandonment Rate Formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/f01smLBFlTDpO5cRRDvQBXbogA.png""><h3>KPI #8. Average Resolution Time</h3><p>Average resolution time measures the time it takes for a customer service executive to resolve a customer issue. A good resolution time can be in the bracket of <a href=""https://www.kapturecrm.com/blog/complete-guide-for-average-resolution-time/"">5 to 6 minutes</a>.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Apart from the product or services you offer, customers are sensitive about the response they get from your customer support executives.</p><p>It might be they are stuck in the middle of a transaction and want quick assistance, or maybe they have raised a ticket - in both scenarios, your resolution time defines customer satisfaction.</p><p>Customers feel more prioritized and supported when you quickly answer their queries.</p><p>On another note, back in their subconscious mind, they feel that even if something goes wrong or they hinder another problem, you are there to help them.</p><p>For SaaS companies, the resolution time typically revolves around support tickets. While for other businesses, it can be from any channel the customer raised a query.</p><p>A low average resolution time means your customer support is very responsive, which results in happy customers.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate it:</p><img alt=""Average Resolution Time formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BCkNE9x61s9LUAej2tpl7wOQ5C0.png""><h3>KPI #9. Bounce Rate</h3><p>Bounce rate is a CX metric that refers to the percentage of visitors leaving a webpage without taking action. The action can be as simple as clicking a link or as complex as going through the checkout process.</p><p>In general, bounce occurs due to several factors, such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Slow page loading time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Poor UI/UX</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Shaggy copywriting</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Unstructured page layout</p></li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>Not every customer that bounces leads to a negative CX, so bounces might be planned, for example, taking a customer from your blog page to a product page.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Let's take it this way, when you stop a visitor from bouncing, you are more likely to increase your conversion rate. Moreover, bounce rates are also considered a significant factor impacting your website's Google search ranking.</p><p>In context to customer experience, a higher bounce rate indicates that customers are not blending in well with the content of your website.

Here's when CSS comes into play. </p><p>You can measure CSS by asking your clients for feedback whenever they interact with your customer support executives.</p><p>It can be through any medium, such as forms, live chats, pop-ups, ratings, and online surveys.</p><p>Keeping these surveys consistent will help you understand your customer service department's leading and lagging areas.

Amused? So were we!</p><p>As of today, customer service is a $350 billion industry. It’s a fair number because retaining customers is better than acquiring new ones.</p><p>Thus, brands are pumping in heavy money to enhance their customer service experience.</p><p>And undoubtedly, data-driven leaders believe quality customer service has a positive impact on businesses. May it be in terms of repeat purchases, higher conversion rates, or word-of-mouth marketing.&nbsp;</p><p>A prolific customer experience can pave the way to the top of the market.</p><p>But how can you measure and improve your customer support? -<em> Customer Service KPIs.</em></p><p>In this article, we'll discuss what customer service KPIs are, how big brands like Apple benefit from them, and what metrics the MANG (Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, &amp; Google) measure to provide quality support to customers.</p><h2>What are KPIs in Customer Service?</h2><p>Customer service KPIs are a set of quantifiable measurements used by customer service or support teams to gauge the effectiveness of their customer service process and determine the progress towards set benchmarks.</p><p>At first, you might think of these KPIs as inferior when compared to other KPIs for profit, costs, revenue, and sales. However, customer service metrics paint a nuanced picture of your business.</p><p>Support KPIs tell you how well your business is bonding with customers and how likely customers are to trust your services.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, for any business, customer satisfaction is directly linked to crucial metrics such as retention rate, net promoter score, total sales, and many more. Hence, these KPIs play a significant role in shaping your customer relation strategies.</p><p>Let's better understand how customer service metrics are essential to your business goals.</p><h2>Why Should A Business Track Customer Service KPIs?</h2><p>As the wise man once said,<em> ""It takes years to build a reputation, but just a moment to ruin it.""</em></p><p>Take Apple, for example. This legacy company holds its spot on the Forbes wall of fame for the 100 most <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/06/30/100-of-the-most-customer-centric-companies/?sh=4008b81863c3"">customer-centric companies</a>. Do you know why?&nbsp;</p><p>Apple belongs to a posh class of the customer-electronic industry. Meaning it sticks to its customers’ mindset and provides seamless customer service for its product and services.</p><p>Technically speaking, Apple employees use the Three F's: Feel, Felt, and Found to empathize and help customers get the perfect tech solutions for their lives.</p><p>This leaves the company with a <a href=""https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2022/06/the-iphone-just-turned-15-how-satisfied.html"">13% customer loyalty score</a> (the % of customers that want to stick to the brand).</p><p>Although the number doesn't sound impressive, it's the highest in the smartphone industry compared to the likes of Google (-36%), Samsung (10%), and Motorola (12%).</p><p>So, now we see why companies are reshaping their customer experience. Especially the boom in online shopping, which leaves you in a bloody-competitive market where retaining customers is the key to long-term success.</p><p>To do so, tracking customer service KPIs can convey a lot about your customer experiences and your customer support management efforts.</p><p>Here's a list of 14 amazing customer service metrics that you should track.</p><h2>What are the 14 Most Important KPIs In Customer Service to Track?</h2><h3>KPI #1. Number of Support Tickets&nbsp;</h3><p>Starting with the most tracked KPI by any customer service manager or team - customer support tickets.</p><p>This KPI measures the number of support tickets or queries generated by customers over a given period.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, the KPI is measured on a weekly or monthly basis to measure and improve performance instantly.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The number of support tickets tells a lot about your product. The higher the tickets, the more issues customers encounter while using your product. Thus, the lower, the better.</p><p>You can even use the title of tickets to figure out what functionality or issues customers encounter the most. Once you know about the most problematic feature, build a solution, and educate your customers.</p><p>Measuring this KPI weekly or monthly is essential because any technical issues or bugs faced by customers can be instantly notified to your technical team in the early stages and resolved over time.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the number of support tickets.</p><img alt=""total support tickets formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hrmvnt2ttkjUh2r6FtxDvzf8Eqk.png""><h3>KPI #2. Number of Resolved Tickets or Ticket Resolution Rate</h3><p>This KPI measures the number of tickets that were resolved from the total number of tickets generated over a given period.&nbsp;</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>How quickly the agents can resolve tickets depicts your team's overall efficiency.</p><p>Generally measured as ticket resolution rate, customer service managers often measure it to gauge executives' efficiency and knowledge base.</p><p>Here's how you can measure it:</p><img alt=""ticket resolution rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zosoW6N2vKVPvsz2qNMGZqYVU4.png""><p>The higher the percentage, the better your executives are performing and the more customers they can help.</p><h3>KPI #3. Tickets Per Customer</h3><p>Ticket per customer is a more granular metric that lets you understand how often an individual customer is facing issues while using your product or service.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Suppose the number of tickets raised by an individual customer is repeatedly rising; they are having a hard time using your product. This can severely impact your product's goodwill and lead to a poor customer experience.</p><p>Likewise, if you see a rise in support tickets for every other customer, it's an alarming sign before customers stop using your product. To keep this metric under control, ensure three things:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Past customer queries are worked upon to avoid repetitive tickets</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Support reps ensure that maximum questions can be answered under one ticket</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Ample amount of helpful resources like blogs, video guides, and tutorials are available for customers to see and learn from</p></li></ul><p>You can use this straightforward formula to calculate ticket per customer:</p><img alt=""tickets per customer formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DPZpN7AeJytRvUUoemAgY42XFM.png""><h3>KPI#4. First Response Time [FRT]</h3><p>The first response time is the measurement of time between the support ticket of a customer and the initial response by an agent. The ticket and response can be from any channel, such as email, chat, or call.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>People being highly impatient, tend to freak out if not attended to. Similarly, slow responses can set your customers off. Hence, customer service managers are keen on tracking this metric.</p><p>Over <a href=""https://www.comm100.com/resources/infographic/millennials-prefer-live-chat-speed-convenience/"">71% of customers</a> believe that a quick response from the service team can significantly improve their buying experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, measuring this KPI can do wonders:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>It lets the customers know that their issues are being looked into as a priority</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>It indicates the promptness of your team's issue addressing ability</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>It helps you better understand your team's capabilities and resources to handle the workload</p></li></ul><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate FRT:</p><img alt=""first response time formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mtQODiADE4LEUss9OKsKcOC4jM.png""><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Deploy an AI-driven chatbot to decrease first response time. The chatbox can easily take forward initial conversations with the customer, allowing agents the time to address a query.&nbsp;</p><h3>KPI #5. Number of Tickets By Channel</h3><p>Customers can reach for support from any channel they like - email, website, call, or live chat.</p><p>This metric helps customer management executives determine which channels or medium generates higher or lower support tickets.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Tracking the source of customer queries allows you to optimize staffing and prioritize channels that can benefit via automation.</p><p>Suppose you receive 100 support tickets per month. Out of 100, 50 are from live chat, 30 are from emails, and 20 are via social media channels.</p><p>This breakdown helps you understand which customer support channels are trafficked and demand more staffing or automation to improve response time.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> By tracking the number of tickets per medium, you prioritize and shift resources to where your customers are.&nbsp;</p><h3>KPI #6. First Contact Resolution Rate [FCR]</h3><p>Do you know what customers really love? They feel hap[y when you resolve their queries at first contact.</p><p>The First Contact Resolution Rate (FCR) refers to the percentage of tickets that are resolved in the first connection itself.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Making your customer jump calls or come again and again for the same issue can lead to a pathetic experience.</p><p>A <a href=""https://ascentgroup.com/"">study</a> by the Ascent group reveals that measuring FCR for 1+ years reports a 1-30% improvement in customer service quality.</p><p>Moreover, this metric helps you gauge your customer satisfaction rate. The higher the FCR, the more satisfied your customers are. You also get to know how well your agents know your product and how efficiently they resolve problems with their knowledge.</p><p>Here's how you can measure FCR:</p><img alt=""first contact resolution formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hrrEibJPmr2QAF8YTPZmqptaTY.png""><h3>KPI #7. Average Resolution Time [ART]</h3><p>Average Resolution Time or ART measures the amount of time taken by agents to resolve an ongoing ticket or query. Like first contact resolution, this metric also impacts your customer satisfaction score.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Resolution time is an important metric for service industries where tickets escalate or move to other departments. Generally, the length of time depends on the complexity of the problem; however, the quicker, the better.</p><p>If you measure the metric per-employee basis, you can figure out which executive is taking longer to resolve tickets and which are your quick problem solvers.</p><p>We analyzed over 6000+ eCommerce stores and found that the average resolution time of the top-performing companies is 1.67 hrs.</p><p>Want to calculate your resolution time? Here's how you can do it.</p><img alt=""average resolution time formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BCkNE9x61s9LUAej2tpl7wOQ5C0.png""><h3>KPI #8. Net Promoter Score [NPS]</h3><p>Net Promoter Score measures the likelihood of a customer recommending your product or service to their friends or contacts.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Net promoter score is a widely used metric that analyzes the customer's relationship with the brand. It's measured on a scale from 0 to 10, where zero is the worst experience, and 10 is the sought-after experience of customers.</p><p>Or, you can simply categorize the responses into three categories:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Detractors (0-6):</strong> The unsatisfied customers who won’t be using or recommending your brand</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Passives (7-8):</strong> Group of satisfied customers who are also vulnerable to competitors</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Promoters (9-10):</strong> The loyal and happy customers who will stick to your brand and recommend it to friends and contacts</p></li></ul><img alt=""nps formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XommhBKlVFPhgvRX6HDWeraYA.jpeg""><p>In this context, you can simply share feedback or survey forms with customers after their query is resolved to understand their views on your support quality.</p><h3>KPI #9. Abandon Conversation Rate</h3><p>Abandon Conversation Rate refers to the number of users that hang up the call before connecting to or getting a resolution from a customer service executive.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Abandon calls are typically due to long waiting queues or poor communication from the agents. Whether the conversation is via email, chat, or phone call, conversation abandonment signals something more significant is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this metric helps managers understand and analyze what's setting off customers. Understanding and improving the pain points can immensely help you enhance your service experience.</p><p>To calculate the abandon conversation rate, you need to track the number of abandon incidents from emails, calls, or live chats. Once you have this data, use the below-given formula:</p><img alt=""conversion abandonment rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/plgA74GxZNupfBbKnw3ku6fiZ94.png""><h3>KPI #10. Customer Retention Rate</h3><p>This key performance indicator measures the rate at which your existing customers use your services or purchase products on a recurring basis.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Retention rate is an important metric to track because 80% of your future revenue will come from 20% of your existing customers. Plus, a lost customer costs you <a href=""https://blog.kissmetrics.com/retaining-customers/"">$243</a> on average.</p><p>And since customer acquisition costs are rising every passing day, retaining existing customers sounds more economically promising for businesses.</p><p>Apart from the factful reasons mentioned above, customer service has a keen role in retaining customers.</p><p>You can work with your customer service reps to draw retention strategies for customers on the brink of exiting. Thereby following up with them via cold calls, offers, troubleshooting, and more.</p><p>Here's the best way to evaluate customer retention rate:</p><img alt=""customer retention rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1ie8OyrHWJYhkLOEsnrrvkU8I.png""><p>Where,</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>CE indicates the number of customers at the end of the process</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>CN refers to the number of new customers acquired during the process, and</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>CS stands for the number of customers at the beginning of the process</p></li></ul><h3>KPI #11.Escalation Rate</h3><p>Escalation rate refers to the number of support tickets that were transferred to another person with more experience and knowledge. This person is generally the customer service manager or an individual with authority.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>A higher escalation rate implies three things:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The lower-level executives are finding it challenging to deal with the problem</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The executive doesn't have adequate authority to resolve the problem on own</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customers are unhappy with the executive's response, thus, want an experienced person on call</p></li></ul><p>Therefore, tracking this metric can help you better understand the issue causing higher escalations.</p><p>If it's regarding a lack of authority to executives to provide solutions, you need to reshape your role-based management strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>But if it's due to the executive's inability to converse, you can set up training and webinars to enhance their skills.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate the escalation rate:</p><img alt=""escalation rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pZdDUH4oSebuvEUnbf735grrBQY.png""><h3>KPI #12. Cost Per Resolution</h3><p>Cost Per Resolution refers to the cost associated with resolving a ticket. It includes the cost of calls, operating expenses, training costs, staffing remunerations, and more.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p><a href=""https://cx-trends-report-2022.zendesk.com/challenges"">48%</a> of customers feel that their customer service expectations have increased over the last few years.</p><p>Now since the expectations are high, the resolutions will be costlier. You would need more professional and trained employees to cope with customer expectations. Hence, cost per resolution is a non-ignorable metric.</p><p>Moreover, you can figure out what portion of your revenue is being put-in into your customer service department. With these insights, you can work on strategies to provide quality services at minimal costs.</p><p>The calculation of cost per resolution is pretty simple.</p><img alt=""cost per resolution formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5CXQBkC79pctf9fY0zbvodR1g.png""><h3>KPI #13. Average Conversion Rate</h3><p>The average conversion rate refers to the number of customers who completed a specific action after conversing with your support team.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Forrester research found that <a href=""https://neilpatel.com/blog/live-chat/"">44% of customers</a> feel that having their questions answered in the middle of the buying journey fascinated them the most. Thus, leading them to make a purchase.</p><p>An interactive pre-sale customer service rep can make all the difference between a sale and a bounce.&nbsp;</p><p>And since you’re pumping $$$ into your customer service department, you don't only expect them to resolve customer issues, do you?</p><p>Instead, you can train executives to push in deals and extra services to customers when and where possible. But for the most part, your support team should be able to help a customer in a way that leads them to take a desirable action, preferably a purchase.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate the average conversion rate:</p><img alt=""average conversion rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/blj7alJTswqJw1cpmAdLDSGZl1c.png""><h3>KPI #14. Tickets Closed Per Agent</h3><p>Pivoting back to the performance of your inbound team, this KPI measures the number of support tickets closed by individual support staff over a given period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The tickets closed per agent metric is used explicitly for measuring employees' performance. Being a customer service executive, the number of closed tickets accounts for your efficiency and productivity at work.</p><p>Moreover, tracking this metric lets you identify your department's best and worst-performing employees. Therefore, allowing you to build data-driven hiring, training, or retention strategies.</p><p>You can just look at your sales CRM to know the number of tickets closed for individual support agents or count it manually.</p><h2>How to Track Customer Service KPIs with Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad homepage"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZgaeWNe8S7o1oq4XUUimGfAw04c.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a mobile-friendly KPI tracking software that allows small to medium size business owners to collect, measure, and analyze critical business metrics from their mobile phones.</p><p>Its mobile-first interface helps you perform every function on your mobile that a typical desktop dashboarding software does - from data extraction to monitoring and customizations, you have it all under your fingertips.</p><p>Here's how you can track customer support KPIs in Datapad in three easy steps.</p><h3>Step 1: Create a Dashboard</h3><p>To begin with, download our app on your mobile (available for both Android and iOS) and sign up with your email address.&nbsp;</p><p>Now open the app, and press the<strong> '+'</strong> sign on the top right corner.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, you need to fill in a name and a few other details to personalize your dashboarding experience.

However, as we said, they have their unique way of monitoring and addressing business KPIs.</p><p>Let's get started by comparing their key features.</p><h3>Datapad Features</h3><p>Datapad is a mobile-friendly tool tailored to fit all your business KPIs into your pocket.</p><p>Our tool is designed in a way to let you collect, monitor, and edit KPIs from anywhere around the world.</p><p>We have tirelessly worked and engineered all the key features that a typical dashboard reporting tool must have.</p><p>Here're a few features that we cherish:</p><h4>#1. Easy Dashboard Creation&nbsp;</h4><p>Being a mobile-first software, you might think dashboard creation may be tedious. But surprisingly, our team has reverse-engineered this myth.</p><p>Datapad allows you to create beautiful dashboards within minutes, even while holding a coffee cup in one hand.</p><img alt=""Datapad create a dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ROggj4n3h3ySyXQT9ASbdUUv6c.gif""><p>With our platform's user-friendly interface, you can customize every section of your dashboard - colors, charts, tables, KPI cards - without writing a single line of code.</p><p>Creating dashboards on software involves a bit of a learning curve. However, our tool has a comparatively lower learning curve than Cyfe and Geckoboard. Therefore, we proudly call it one of the most comfortable dashboarding solutions for beginners.</p><h4>#2. Team Collaboration</h4><p>Another cool feature of Datapad is team collaboration. Cyfe and Geckoboard have a team collaboration feature, but it’s not as quick as Datapad.</p><img alt=""add user in app datapad"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oD3Wv0dnLHN9qfuMpahcmFdhtI.gif""><p>What's more, Datapad helps you communicate with your team in real-time. For example, you and your team can simply comment under a KPI you're tracking to broadcast messages.&nbsp;</p><img alt=""datapad in app commenting feature"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DcFsXfNYPOLJQaXZtliJcj5uPls.gif""><p>With a single tap, you can easily:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Onboard team members</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Assign tasks and set goals for every KPI</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Easily communicate around metrics</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get real-time notifications and alerts</p></li></ul><p>Let’s understand it with an example.</p><p>Suppose one of your KPIs is trending downwards and seeks immediate attention. Unlike Cyfe or Geckoboard, where you're asked to share the dashboard with the team and communicate over slack or other channels.</p><p>Datapad allows you to leave a comment under that particular KPI, send alerts to your team, and share opinions in the comment section, all in real-time.</p><p>This feature is a life-saver when dealing with time-sensitive situations. Thereby helping you make tough calls and collaborative data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently.</p><h4>#3. Mobile-Friendly Dashboards</h4><p>When it comes to mobile-friendly dashboards, our tool has got the upper hand.</p><p>Cyfe and Geckoboard don’t have a dedicated mobile app for their software. Cyfe provides mobile-friendly dashboards, but that's not even close to what our tool offers.</p><img alt=""datapad dashboard overview"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1iD1mpclopyNrRBi50ka9EBKOHk.gif""><p>Dashboards designed with our tool are flawlessly optimized for responsiveness and are compatible with all known small-screen devices.</p><p>In addition, it's optimized for lightning-fast speed and sheer performance. Thereby avoiding any lags or delays in tracking your business performance.</p><p>On a second note, dashboards created on Cyfe and Geckoboard can be viewed on mobile phones, but as they are not entirely optimized for mobile devices, you're left scrolling down or zooming in through your dashboard to track KPIs.</p><p>Datapad's mobile-friendly app allows you to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get instant access (view and edit) to important KPIs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Build mobile optimized dashboards (no double work for desktop)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Blazing-fast loading time and smooth navigation across pages</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Powerful data visualization tools&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4>#4. Automatic and Manual Data Entry</h4><p>Although Cyfe and Geckoboard may hold top positions in terms of integrations, Datapad, being comparatively new software, provides advanced data control with automatic and manual data entry capabilities.</p><p>Datapad's robust integrations allow you to easily import data from multiple sources into one unified dashboard with a click.</p><img alt=""Datapad add metric with data sources"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/KLEyZ57aUcKQqbAg53Cx6iqfSOI.gif""><p>Or, if you feel like the database is too large and want to segment your data, you can manually input the data you want to monitor.</p><img alt=""datapad add metric manually"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1bfQMWCtcyAK2dDm9VxVlgtQB4Y.gif""><h3>Cyfe Features</h3><p>Cyfe, being a popular all-in-one tool, has a lot to bring to the table. Therefore, we reviewed its key features.</p><h4>#1. Advanced Dashboard Creation</h4><p>Cyfe has an extensive gallery of dashboard templates and 250+ metrics to help you easily and quickly create dashboards. From social media dashboard templates to web analytics and youtube - you can find tailored dashboards for every purpose.</p><img alt=""cyfe vs geckoboard features"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/y1X6F9edLm1CmTPkBLwNA1Bqs.png""><p>Although Cyfe doesn't have a mobile version of its platform, the dashboards are designed to be mobile-friendly.</p><p>Besides this, Cyfe allows you to create dashboards in 15 different languages. To change language, simply navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Change language</strong> and customize your dashboard language as preferred by your co-workers or clients.</p><p>You can also create custom dashboards and metrics by blending multiple data points from completely different data connectors.&nbsp;</p><h4>#2. Team Collaborations</h4><p>Team collaboration is an essential feature of any dashboard reporting tool.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, Cyfe doesn't allow you to communicate over its platform; however, you can export your dashboard with a click, as shown below.</p><img alt=""cyfe export dashboard feature"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/GhKJhlg8eilr24JSKbrqa3Xh3CM.png""><p>Or, you can share your dashboard with teams and stakeholders via smart links.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we talked about uniqueness, Cyfe offers a share-to-TV feature allowing you to display dashboards in conferences or meetings. Or even throughout the office to avoid blindspots and keep your team aligned with the trends.</p><p>In short, to support team collaboration, Cyfe allows you to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Schedule automatic email reports of your data in multiple formats</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get alerts regarding team activities or change in KPI trends via email or SMS</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Use the share-to-TV feature to share live dashboards on office TV screens</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Share dashboards via smart link or as csv</p></li></ul><h4>#3. White-Label Customizations</h4><p>Now, this is something that Datapad doesn't offer (not yet), and Geckoboard offers it as an add-on.</p><p>Cyfe, however, has pre-embedded white-labeling options to customize your dashboard with the look and feel of your organization.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1pAscDklcQUt3KNLAG7i1bubq5U.png""><p>You can create branded reports by customizing everything from your domain name to dashboard backgrounds and more.</p><h4>#4. Mobile-Optimization</h4><p>Compared to Datapad, Cyfe doesn't have a dedicated mobile app. But this doesn't stop its dashboards from being mobile-friendly. Cyfe web-based app is perfectly optimized for mobile devices. And so it's easy to monitor your dashboard from mobile phones.</p><p>However, when we tried configuring the widget, we encountered a pop-up.</p><img alt=""Cyfe mobile dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/q29xIj2Vzcc1n562OB9BMPM1u8.jpeg""><p>Yes, for configuring or customizing KPI cards, you need to sit in front of your desktop. Unfortunately, that isn't a mobile-friendly thing we found here.</p><p>But fortunately, we built Datapad to keep you away from desktops. 🤓</p><p>Moving on to what Geckoboard has to offer.</p><h3>Geckoboard Features</h3><p>Undoubtedly, Geckoboard is a leading business intelligence KPI dashboarding software that helps you create amazing business dashboards. In fact, 1000s of companies trust it for KPI tracking and visualization purposes.</p><p>So let's compare its features with that of Cyfe and Datapad.</p><h4>#1. Create Professional Dashboards</h4><img alt=""Geckoboard dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/vmbjRdR2X0JukQvR7pNbx5OPPM.png""><p>Compared to Cyfe and Datapad, Geckoboard has a comprehensive dashboard layout. Its dashboards allow you to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Easily update or swap metrics</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Spot interesting trends and spikes</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Capability of presenting real-time data without much lag</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Show how different parts of the business are performing without compiling reports</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Call out start performers and keep morale high</p></li></ul><p>You can also use filters to select the exact metrics and ranges you need and visualize them the way you like.</p><h4>#2. Team Collaboration</h4><p>Dashboards created via Geckoboard have a dedicated section for star performers. Meaning that you can include the information of your top-performing employees within the dashboard.</p><p>This gets better with Geckobaord's display-to-TV feature, which allows you to display live dashboards on TV screens.</p><img alt=""geckoboard team collaboration"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Gjf1F2ThXPrlRUmK7Jz1UPCcgM.png""><p>Imagine your name surfacing on the big TV screen in your office, quite a day for you! (if it's for a good thing, of course, 🤣)</p><p>You can also share dashboard links with your remote team members or schedule dashboard snapshots to send via email or slack.</p><h4>#3. Ease of Data Import&nbsp;</h4><p>In terms of data importing, Geckoboard might have the upper hand on Datapad due to its vast number of integrations and collection of robust APIs.</p><img alt=""Geckoboard data connectors list"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RZIxzW6mgNhhvd48hHxEZaNj5U.png""><p>In addition, its one-click integration feature helps you collect data from literally anywhere.</p><p>You can quickly drill down your data and generate hidden insights by mixing custom metrics from multiple platforms.</p><div><br></div><h2>Datapad vs. Cyfe vs. Geckoboard Supported Integrations</h2><h3>Datapad</h3><p>Building a full-fledged dashboard with very little data is a nightmare for business owners. And hence, with Datapad, you get one-click integrations to multiple data sources and platforms. You can pull in all your data with ease from popular platforms, including:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Sheets</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Analytics</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Facebook Ads</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>MySQL</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>SQL Server</p></li></ul><p>Our team is tirelessly working on integrating some of the popular data sources such as Shopify, Tableau, HubSpot, and more.</p><img alt=""Datapad integrations"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/TxM0WzygN1kNXP6WV0TyANqGJo.png""><h3>Cyfe</h3><p>Cyfe has close to 100 data sources, which makes it ace the game of integrations when compared to Datapad and Geckoboard. Some of its integrations include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Analytics</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Salesforce</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>MailChimp</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Shopify</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google AdSense</p></li></ul><p>Plus, it has one-click integrations to various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, and more. You can even request custom integrations by filling out the <strong>'Data Source Request'</strong> form on their integrations page.</p><img alt=""cyfe integrations"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mBPqoOE6TrX1DAsRjGYEqucub0.png""><h3>Geckoboard</h3><p>With Geckoboard, you can import data from over 80+ data sources. Some of its popular integrations include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Microsoft Excel</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Github</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>HubSpot</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Social Media Platforms</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Shopify</p></li></ul><p>The platform also allows you to pull additional data using spreadsheets, databases, Zapier integrations, Zendesk, and custom APIs. Moreover, similar to Cyfe, you can request other integration by filling out a simple form.</p><img alt=""Geckoboard integrations"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/vIjzwbih7ZK1onSUaUQXLFdqgiQ.png""><h3>Wrapping Up Integrations</h3><p>If we compare by number, Cyfe holds the top spot with over 100+ integrations.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, its custom APIs assist you in pulling in data from sources that are still not integrated into Cyfe.</p><div><br></div><h2>Datapad vs. Cyfe vs Geckoboard &nbsp;Pricing</h2><p>Now you might be curious about the pricing of each tool.</p><h3>Datapad</h3><p>Our tool (Datapad) doesn't cost you anything except your time. The tool is free to use, and we're currently providing <strong>'1-on-1 onboarding' </strong>and setting things up for you.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Cyfe</h3><p>Cyfe follows a simple pricing mode based on a fixed number of dashboards and users and offers a 14-day free trial with all its plans. Besides that, it has four premium plans:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Starter: </strong>$19/month</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Standard: </strong>$29/month</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Pro:</strong> $49/month</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Premier: </strong>$89/month</p></li></ul><p>Cyfe also offers custom plans for agencies starting at $150/month</p><img alt=""Cyfe pricing options"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/idGCXHfHf1TstPQvSA2WboVlkE.png""><h3>Geckoboard</h3><p>Geckoboard comes with a free plan that includes a single spreadsheet-powered dashboard. However, its pricing policy is more complex than Cyfe's. What we mean is, besides the default features offered, if you increase the number of dashboards, the pricing increases drastically.</p><p>The platform offers three plans:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Essential: </strong>$49/month</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Pro: </strong>$99/month</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Scale: </strong>$699/month</p></li></ul><img alt=""Geckoboard pricing options"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oCulxhs7Ydi0sgsmcU5R5VC5y5U.png""><div><br></div><h3>What Are Customers Saying?</h3><p>Apart from our unbiased opinions, we felt the need to keep the customer's perspective first. So let's hear it out from each tool’s customers.</p><h3>Datapad&nbsp;</h3><p>Here are a couple of screenshots from Product Hunt about what people think of our tool - Datapad.</p><p><em>“The product looks promising for people who are crazy about numbers and charts like me :) I like the design of the landing page, looks dope.” - Product Hunt.</em></p><p>‍</p><img alt=""Datapad customer review"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/xo7VPbWN8l9sxB2HIWL93MWAGME.png""><p><em>“I'm really impressed with the Datapad!

We will also share some tips and tricks to implement these principles into your dashboard creation process seamlessly.</p><p>And lastly, we have some great dashboard examples to inspire your thoughts.</p><p>Whenever you’re ready! 🏁</p><h2>What Are the Key Design Principles of Great Dashboards?&nbsp;</h2><p>To design stunning dashboards, you should take into account the <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/Gestalt-psychology"">Gestalt Principles</a>. It tells you a great deal about visual perception and colors to use in a dashboard.</p><p>Gestalt Principles are a set of rules that describe how the human eye groups similar elements, recognize patterns and simplify complex images when we perceive objects. These principles are a crucial part of any design concept.</p><p>To sum up, a great dashboard is a blend of five fundamental design principles.</p><h3>#1. Enclosure</h3><p>If you put a series of elements or objects inside an enclosed section, they are considered a group. Our brain subconsciously fills in gaps between elements to perceive them as a complete image.</p><p>Suppose we say you placed a scatter diagram with reference lines surrounding the objects.&nbsp;</p><img alt=""key principles of great dashboard design "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/AAb2F3GfWAV3Z7rN7JPznH8NAQ.png""><p>Now, you might have included several elements into it, but the user will view it as a complete image because it's enclosed under a boundary (our brain interprets the axes of the graph as its boundaries).</p><p>You can use graph enclosures in creative ways to win users' trust when they recognize complete images from cleverly placed elements.</p><h3>#2. Proximity</h3><p>It's the tendency to visualize multiple elements as a group when we put close-together elements, separating them from those farther apart.</p><p>For example, when you cluster multiple elements into one area on your dashboard, the user's mind will visualize it as one group distinct from everything else on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>#3. Similarity</h3><p>A great dashboard tells the data story by itself. And it’s not what viewers have to search through.</p><p>To do the same for your dashboard, include similar objects and elements in the same closed area.&nbsp;</p><p>This helps your brain identify such elements easily and keeps you engaged and focused.</p><p>Facebook, for example, uses this principle for its interaction design, where likes, comments, and other interactions appear within the boundaries of one post and so stand apart from others.</p><img alt=""great dashboard example"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1ofs4mZlMQ6prU1diRhkFcA1Fbg.png""><h3>#4. Continuation</h3><p>We perceive several objects aligned closely as a continuous body, and our brain coordinates with our eyes to follow the continuation because it just feels right!</p><p>This is because we as humans hate uncertainty and preach for things that have stability.</p><p>Imagine you’re looking at a linear graph. No, when you look at an upward trend, you will continue to do so until there’s something that breaks the continuity.</p><p>Don’t believe us? Time to test the waters in:</p><p>3…2…1</p><img alt=""great dashboard principle - continuation"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/gcMIE2ZOaqeCUqh407CzhErcyQ.png""><h2>What Makes a Great Dashboard?</h2><p>Now that you know how to structure your dashboard to make it appealing to the user's mind let's walk you through the qualities or features of a great dashboard.</p><h3>#1. Easy Access for Everyone</h3><p>First and foremost, a great dashboard comes with great accessibility. Imagine creating a dashboard that your team finds hard to access. After some time, users might not even care to open the dashboard as it's so hectic and time-consuming.</p><p>To escape this phase, ensure that accessing the dashboard doesn't require more than a click - no multiple logins, no delays in loading, and quick onboarding.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, your dashboard should be easily shareable (via links) so a team member sitting even at the remotest location can access it on the go.&nbsp;</p><h3>#2. Clear Visuals&nbsp;</h3><p>Another vital component of a great dashboard is its visuals. The diagrams, colors, and fonts - everything should align in a unified format to present your data in an easy-to-understand manner.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, you can avoid using too many data visualization elements.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Datapad’s Tip:</strong> A great dashboard is always simple, clean, and pleasant to the eyes.</p><h3>#3. Gives You a Holistic View&nbsp;</h3><p>If someone asks you about the purpose of the dashboard you build for your business, you should know it.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some purposes you might give to a KPI dashboard:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Tracking monthly sales of a product</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Tracking supply chain KPIs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The dashboard tracks all e-commerce KPIs&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Ensure that the dashboard you create gives a bird-eye view of your business. It must contain all the information to serve its purpose. Any leaks or missing data can unintentionally manipulate your decisions.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Have a Great Dashboard Design?</h2><p>Apart from the theoretical principles and the critical features, here're a few of our well-researched tips for creating a stunning dashboard.</p><h3>Tip #1. Be Clear of Your Dashboard’s Purpose</h3><img alt=""be clear of your dashboard's purpose"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/HAy6PXoXL8keC2BqJpztBqLt6c.png""><p>To begin with, you must be clear about what you are trying to achieve from the dashboard (usability). Is it the company's financial health? Or your store's traffic?</p><p>Try to answer questions like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What do you want to achieve from the dashboard?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Who is it for?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What do you want them to do differently because of it?</p></li></ul><p>It's actually the most crucial step because if you get this wrong, the whole concept of building a dashboard goes down the drain. Whether your dashboard is for a bigger picture or finding and resolving a problem quickly, there has to be a purpose!&nbsp;</p><h3>Tip #2. Avoid Putting in Everything You See</h3><img alt=""good dashboard design vs bad design "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/02K5cyTRD9qLgC3thSb22UZlU9Y.png""><p>We know you have a plate full of content and data, but your dashboard doesn't need a high-quantity diet. Instead, it seeks something minimal in quantity and more in value.&nbsp;</p><p>It helps improve the UX design of the dashboard and the white space in the dashboard soothes the eyes be it a web design or mobile.</p><p>You've already defined your goals and KPIs; adding those is a great starting point. Just make sure everything circles the purpose of your board.</p><p>The screen presenting your dashboard is limited. Therefore, you must utilize every inch of it. Adding not-so-important information can confuse viewers right from the start.</p><p>So, here's how to filter your dashboard KPIs and elements:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Put-in elements and metrics that match the sole purpose of your dashboard</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Check if the KPIs can easily be understood and influenced by your team</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Prioritize those metrics which are highly volatile and need regular tracking</p></li></ul><h3>Tip #3. Don't Forget to Use a Grid Layout In Your Dashboard UI</h3><img alt=""grid layout in dashboard design "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/omTLIaZF1MemSod0j9sTlVLpjQ.png""><p>Although this sounds boring, consider a grid format when placing objects on a dashboard (views, filters, titles, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>You may ask why?</p><p>In designer's terms, a grid layout is a structure made up of a series of intersections of vertical and horizontal lines serving as a framework to structure your content.&nbsp;</p><p>It not only shapes your content but also enhances content readability. The grid framework helps you organize your graphic elements in a rational and easy-to-understand format.</p><h3>Tip #4. Keep An Eye on Data Ink Ratio</h3><img alt=""dashboard data ink ration"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FhuePN0SUpNm0VdGBxvkhS28.png""><p>The concept of Data Ink Ratio was first introduced by Edward R. Tufte, an information visualization expert at Yale University.</p><p>According to the concept, data-ink is a non-erasable core of the graphic. It's important enough to have a formula dedicated to calculating the ratio.</p><img alt=""data ink ratio formulation"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DXgiwn2o30S7p0GX6IITv8JFmQ.png""><p><a href=""https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Data-Ink_Ratio"">Source</a></p><p>Here,</p><p>'Ink' represents the proportion of graphics used.&nbsp;</p><p>In simpler terms, Tufte suggests erasing that extra ink that doesn't add new information to the graphic, i.e., using less ink (chart elements), is more effective and attractive from the user's perspective.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The term 'Ink' is used because the concept has been around since the pre-digital age.&nbsp;</p><p>Well-designed dashboards aim to use as little non-data ink as possible – in Tufte's words, they have an excellent data-ink ratio.</p><p>That means removing unnecessary data-ink used by colorful backgrounds, quirky Illustrations, gridlines, icons, and labels - merely anything that doesn't communicate any data can significantly improve your dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Maintaining a low-data ink ratio is great because it prevents dashboard viewers from getting distracted due to unnecessary elements.</p><h3>Tip #5. Choose the Right Data Visualization</h3><img alt=""choose the right chart type"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nuX7Ucd4Fwl0snV9tw4F7SiDTZQ.png""><p>Fancy visualization elements are great for other design purposes, but not when designing a dashboard.</p><p>When creating dashboards, always choose the visualization elements that clearly communicate what you want to say with your data.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, sometimes it’s tough to read a pie chart for a specific dataset. Use bar charts or line charts instead.</p><p>Some elements like pie charts and area graphs are hard to understand at a glance, and so they are not a popular choice among dashboard designers.</p><p>However, a combination of bars, numbers, lines, and tables would do enough for you. Also, if a specific visualization element is perfect for every data set, there's no harm in using it again and again (just be creative with it, don't make it look monotonous).</p><h3>Tip #6. Keep UI Design Simple: Less Is More</h3><img alt=""Keep UI design simple "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/O2YC0czRpYa167VCucCx27vWFBw.png""><p>Again, a simple design template can be more attractive and effective than a clustered design (remember the data-ink ratio?).&nbsp;</p><p>Try keeping your dashboard clean, filtering out unnecessary information, finding ways to combine multiple small blocks, and eliminating unwanted elements as soon as possible.</p><p>This is the right way to create an effective dashboard for you and your team.</p><p>Take a minimalistic approach to dashboard creation; the simpler the design, the more data-focused your dashboard will be.</p><h3>Tip #7. Create a Hierarchy or Streamlined Flow of Information</h3><img alt=""streamlined low of information on dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/H1xTimTsljSaUTnmzErCbVAxGQ.png""><p>We mentioned how important it’s to create an easy-to-understand dashboard, and building a hierarchy in your dashboard design process adds a ton to the process.</p><p>When left with limited data and content, it isn't easy to provide users with a streamlined flow of information on the dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>But here's the thing; you can use custom size and position to emphasize the metrics that matter most and downsize metrics that need less attention.</p><p>For example, suppose we say if you want viewers to notice a metric instantly, the top left corner of your dashboard is the best location as that's where your eyes are naturally drawn to first.</p><p>Hierarchy also helps you keep the most important information on top.</p><h3>Tip #8. Round Your Numbers and Give Them Context</h3><img alt=""round your numbers"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7WtG3uI8xEi2D6rDoF5jC6zls.png""><p>Decimals have been a nightmare for many since school. And honestly, you don't need to be very precise with numbers. A simple figure is more convincing to the eyes than a number with three decimals attached to it.</p><p>In addition, just displaying numbers won't help the viewers better understand your analysis. Try adding context to the numbers by comparing past performances and showing growth trajectories, including averages, current progress rates, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Basically, anything that builds a story around the number. Similarly, add context to every KPI or metric to make them self-explanatory; at the same time, use compact and small-sized fonts to avoid cluttering.</p><h3>Tip #9. Don't Hesitate to Be Consistent</h3><img alt=""be consistent with design "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zi8G1gNYndZMVyG1xlwsNKhTaSM.png""><p>People generally have a solid photogenic memory of what they see. And so, playing around with too much visualization might confuse them.</p><p>Instead, it's always wise to use repetitive or consistent graphs, colors, and fonts for dashboards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't try adding anything that's hard for the viewers to absorb. Not a wise choice, indeed.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tip #10. Collaborate and Iterate</h3><img alt=""dashboard collaboration"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/3ZO9bM3i9XGMypioRw11hA9JM.png""><p>Lastly, work towards building a dynamic dashboard - you can A/B test such dashboards easily and share them across the team with a single click.&nbsp;</p><p>Ensure that your dashboard is easily workable by your team members and provides real-time collaboration to support team building and unified decision-making.</p><p>The best way to test your dashboard is to ask for feedback from your team and other administrators. Use that feedback to update your dashboards with necessary changes.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take these 10 tips as dashboard design best practices and go through the list wherever creating a dashboard.</p><h2>7 Types of Dashboard Design Examples We Loved</h2><p>Our team at Datapad reviewed several dashboard designs this year, and here're 7 dashboard design examples we loved and had a great user experience.</p><h3>#1.

However, modern problems require modern solutions. 😉</p><p>Platforms such as Datapad, Geckoboard, Databox, etc., help you create stunning dashboards with dynamic visual aids and analytical capabilities.</p><p>But with so many opinions available, how do you vouch for a dashboard that's perfect for your business needs?&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t worry, we’ll help you out. ✌🏻</p><h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best Dashboard Software For Your Team</h2><img alt=""4 factors to consider for dashboard tool"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/cZdagJk1uKE5Thpk5RUGTdIoduk.png""><h3>#1. Is It Easy Enough for You to Set Up?</h3><p>Implementation is the most difficult part when getting your dashboard up and running. A typical dashboard tool can take up to a few minutes or even days to set up, depending on the assistance provided by the software.</p><p>Ensure that the platform provides adequate resources to help with initial configuration, like online setup guides, video tutorials, 'how-to' blogs, excellent customer support service, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to gauge this factor is to check the platform's online customer reviews. We highly recommend this because customers have a lot to unfold about the tools they use online.&nbsp;</p><h3>#2. Would It Give You Quick Access to Your Dashboards?</h3><p>Since you’re choosing a dashboard software to save time and resources, would you mind if the tool consumes the same time buffering?</p><p>Certain factors, such as multiple logins, poor navigation, and long-loading time prevent you from getting quick access to your dashboards.</p><p>Again, make use of online reviews and ratings to compare tools that offer efficient workflow vs. those that act as bottlenecks in quickly presenting the information you need.</p><h3>#3. Can You Have Access on the Go?</h3><p>Some dashboards are desktop-ridden – you can only access them while sitting against your system. Eventually, this limits you from staying updated or accessing your dashboard when you’re away or off work.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, your business is running 24/7 with or without you monitoring it. And leaving it unattended until office hours might be a little problematic at times.</p><p>So, ensure that the tool offers mobile-friendly dashboard solutions. Or even better, it comes with a dedicated mobile app. Any of these can help you access your dashboard on your mobile phone in real-time, regardless of your place or time.</p><h3>#4.

But first, let's understand - why you might need a DashThis alternative in the first place?</p><div><br></div><h2>Why You Might Need a DashThis Alternative?</h2><h3>Reason #1. Poor User Interface</h3><p>When tracking KPIs for your business, having an excellent CX will keep you interested and ease your work.&nbsp;</p><p>If a dashboard is poorly designed, has a shabby layout, and lacks finesse, tracking and analyzing data can be a nightmare for you.</p><p>Did you know that almost <a href=""https://truelist.co/blog/ux-statistics/"">90% of users</a> don't use the software or revisit a site that has a poor user interface? This is a major concern, and DashThis has failed to act on it.</p><p>DashThis is a decade-old company but has failed to bring forth a modernized product that business owners love.</p><p>Look at the ‘Cons’ section here:</p><img alt=""G2 negative Dashthis review -1 "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/JbcSe0d5JDDt2gsiiAUXMCgZs.png""><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg; if you skim through DashThis's review on Capterra, G2, and other such sites, you will find many people complaining about visualization.</p><h3>Reason #2. Limited Customization Options</h3><p>Let's face it; when you invest in a product (especially in dashboard software), the first thing you see is if you can customize the platform according to your business needs. This is non-negotiable for many managers and company owners.</p><p>Customization and personalization go hand in hand, and people love it. So much so that <a href=""https://startupbonsai.com/personalization-statistics/"">80% of customers</a> are more likely to buy from a brand that gives them a tailored experience.</p><p>DashThis has customization features, but they're basic. Apart from this, the platform also lacks some automation features.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you can’t get automated alerts on your emails when a KPI you’re tracking falls or rises out of your set benchmark. Everyone expects this basic automation when they pay for a tool monthly, right?</p><h3>Reason #3. Steep Learning Curve</h3><p>Most business owners and managers don't want a tool that's too complex for them to understand, let alone use on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the catch, to use DashThis, you first have to sit and learn its intricacies, which means spending hours sorting things out.</p><p>Good luck with that :)&nbsp;</p><p>And then, when you've finally mastered it, it might be too late for a specific KPI to track.</p><p>Now that you know why you must consider a DashThis alternative, it's time to see your potential options.</p><h2>What Are The Best DashThis Alternatives?</h2><div><br></div><h2>#1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> helps you track all essential <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">metrics </a>from stunning dashboards.</p><p>The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use.

Poor Customer Support</h3><p>For any SaaS platform, customer support is one of the best ways to retain clients.&nbsp;</p><p>If you help your customers when they need you the most, your customer retention rate could be through the roof, but, at the same time, if you fail to put your customers’ needs before yours, your business will crumble.</p><p><a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-stats"">According to HubSpot</a>, 90% of customers in America use customer service as a factor when deciding to spend on a product/service.&nbsp;</p><p>Databox doesn’t have a great customer service department. The users are quite angry with the time Databox’s customer reps take to reply to them.</p><p>Here’s one such example:</p><img alt=""G2 Databox negative customer review"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hDxSH89PjLKQk8QpUEQJWGB9DU.png""><h3>Reason #2. Problematic Date Range Feature</h3><p>When we tested out <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/databox-pricing"">Databox</a>, we found out that the platform lacks the date range selection feature, meaning you can’t select a specific date range and track KPIs.</p><p>Let us explain to you what we mean by that.</p><p>Suppose you're tracking a KPI - retention rate, and you want to know the retention rate from 3rd February to 10rd May 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Databox simply doesn’t let you filter data that way. The only options you get to filter data are - daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.</p><p>Date range feature is essential for tracking as you might need to know your growth in a specific time period.</p><h3>Reason #3. Lacks Complex Report Creation&nbsp;</h3><p>With Databox, you can create a simple dashboard for data analysis, but when you have complex and long data, it fails to convert them into a dashboard.</p><p>Also, sometimes its data sources cannot connect your historical data to the platform, which might lead to data loss. This can be a major issue, as you could lose thousands of dollars worth of data in seconds.</p><p>Now that you know why you might need to switch from Databox to some other KPIs tracking dashboard software, it’s time to see your potential options.</p><h2>9 Best Databox Alternatives to Try Out in 2024</h2><h2>#1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> helps you track all essential <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">metrics </a>from stunning dashboards.</p><p>The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use.

Databox Free-Forever Plan</h2><p>Databox free-forever plan offers daily monitoring and reporting of high-level metrics for small teams. However, the free-forever version has a lot more to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>With the free-forever plan, you get three data source connections and dashboards, respectively.</p><p>Moreover, the plan allows five users, daily data sync frequency, and upto 11 months of historical data accessibility.</p><p>Apart from this, the plan has over 12+ standard features, including:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Dashboard designer</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Goal setting</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Scoreboards and alerts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Scheduled snapshots&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>250+ public dashboard templates&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, you can connect your data using 60+ pre-built databox integrations and create stunning visualization using its 2000+ third-party integrations with Zapier and Integromat.</p><img alt=""databox free pricing plan"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/u3iFGCBv1zUz3nnrPlb969K1g.png""><p>But, with just three data source connections, you are limited to 5GB of storage space.</p><h3>Drawbacks</h3><p>Although Databox is a leading dashboarding software in the industry, it does have some drawbacks. We came across a few disadvantages backed by customer reviews. So let's get through them.</p><h4>#1. Limited Data Source Connections</h4><p>What's it like to <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-build-dashboard"">build a dashboard</a> without data? It doesn’t make sense, right?</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/m6NLPJoLTZIRRxX3AdASGdKDY.png""><p>Databox free-forever plan offers only three data connections, restricting data import from multiple platforms and applications storing your data.</p><h4>#2. Doesn’t Support White-labeling</h4><p>There's no white labeling included in the free version. Not even as an add-on. You have to carry the Databox branding throughout your dashboards and reports. So if you’re a marketing agency looking for white-label reports, you will have to purchase a paid plan.</p><h2>#2. Databox Starter Pack</h2><p>Like the free-forever plan, the starter plan offers daily monitoring and reporting of high-level metrics. It also has a trial period for paid plans - no credit card required.</p><p>However, the pricing is variable based on the required data connections. For example, you get four data source connections and dashboards at $72/month (if paid annually, otherwise $91/mo), six connections and dashboards for $76/month, and so on.</p><img alt=""databox starter plan"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zh4GDh93JcSdVhX3BBKkdK87OUw.png""><p>For the most part, the starter pack has everything that Databox’s free-forever plan offers, but of course, adding extra data source connections and dashboards is a plus.</p><p>Also, with the starter pack, you get 20 GB of storage and can personalize your dashboard with your business color palette and branding.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, you are allowed for a white-labeling add-on for $250/month.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/LJ3vJgA0OuPaQZwb981JyIIPoU.png""><h3>Drawbacks</h3><h4>#1. No-Free Google Sheets Integration</h4><p>A significant drawback of the Databox starter pack is that you don't get google sheets integrations. One needs to upgrade to a higher plan to get it.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5RkIF3yGQdxCl1keTE3p2AEvyGs.png""><p>That's bizarre, considering that Google has a free dashboard called Google Data Studio (a competitor of Databox) that offers it for free.&nbsp;</p><h4>#2. High Pricing</h4><p>Comparably, Databox's starting price is higher than the average starting fee in the industry. Making it challenging for beginners to opt for its most basic paid plan.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Vks4BRhnS2faxI8lzpKe5E15zU.png""><h4>#3. Does Not Support Query Builder</h4><p>‍</p><p>Databox free-forever and starter plans don't include query builders.&nbsp;</p><p>Query builder is a tool that helps users create custom metrics. With that being not available, creating custom metrics is not as easy as it seemed with Databox paid plans.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/M8vqmG76DE3hczGpHJcYujYJWM.png""><h2>#3. Databox Professional Plan</h2><p>Databox professional plan provides hourly monitoring and analysis of high-level metrics. The plan is best suited for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>Initially, the professional plan includes three data source connections and nine dashboards at $169/month. As you increase the data sources, the pricing goes up.</p><p>The maximum you can go is 50 data connections and 150 dashboards, but this will cost you $357 per month.</p><p>Diving into the features, Databox professional plan includes every feature put along with the starter plan and some essential features like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Sheets integration</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>SQL database integrations</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Query Builder</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Data Calculations</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Custom Date Ranges</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Removable branding</p></li></ul><p>The query builder embedded with the plan allows you to create up to 300 custom metrics. Plus, you are free to select a custom date range.</p><img alt=""databox professional plan"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Q9McXELcs3Eg4nfWXbhbz3gMehg.png""><h3>Drawbacks</h3><h4>#1. Limited Customizations</h4><p>We frequently came across reviews where customers were unsatisfied with Databox customization options.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XNJBVpEREBFmwEoUNX05s8i1wkw.png""><p>While some customers find Databox unsuitable for non-technical guys, others were seen struggling to create eye-catchy visualizations and were unable to drill down data at par.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RfPNxUDK6AFL5z7v0ttOl3tco.png""><h4>#2. Limited Integrations&nbsp;</h4><p>With Databox, you are accustomed to certain limitations of third-party app integrations. For example, you can't integrate Ahrefs without custom development.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BbavNLcJulb3pO0VTX4ab9Yxrc.png""><p>Moreover, some popular data source connections like Facebook AdManager are missing from the box.&nbsp;</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mjwPcgOFsN4CMvCrpBvg9VLBgFw.png""><h2>#4. Databox Performer Plan</h2><p>Databox's performer plan is your best option if you're serious about improving the performance of your business. It assists you with the on-demand monitoring of crucial metrics.</p><p>With 3 data source connections and unlimited dashboards, you can get the performer plan for $289/month. But, again, as you increase the number of data sources, the pricing increases significantly (maximum pricing: $571/month).</p><p>Unlike other subscription plans, the performer plans have no limitation to the number of users you onboard or the number of dashboards you create - it's unlimited.</p><p>Plus, the plan offers hourly and priority data sync frequency. The query builder embedded with this plan permits upto 1000 custom metrics allowing you to dive deep into the granular view of your business performance.</p><p>But that's not all. Databox's performance plan has more to it:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Activity-based Priority Sync&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Fiscal Calendars</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Supports Single Sign-on (SSO)</p></li></ul><img alt=""databox performer plan"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/IylkG09jWFpzTVvJOsDhHqei5g.png""><h3>Drawbacks</h3><h4>#1. Bugs &amp; Glitches</h4><p>Even after paying a comparably higher price for Databox's subscriptions, the software is fond of bugs and glitches.&nbsp;</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/E08V51mBkz8LUMiP9aMiOA87EM.png""><p>Although the bugs are fixed consistently by their customer support, there's no immediate solution to the problem.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hTeEdyf0xKuXWpMbQZ01UvrFcE.png""><p>Imagine creating the perfect dashboard and encountering glitches at the very end. No matter how good their customer support is, these minor errors hinder the overall workflow of businesses and teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Looking for a Databox Alternative?</h2><p>Till now you might’ve got the idea about the pricing model of Databox. If you think it’s an expensive tool and want to explore your alternatives, here are some of them.&nbsp;</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nT6M56j0ujA1RS0OJ5Es6MpPfM.png""><h2>How Does Datapad Differ From Databox?</h2><p>Unlike Databox, Datapad is a modern-day dashboarding and analytics tool that allows business owners to track, monitor, and analyze their business performance from their mobile phones.</p><p>When comparing the two, Databox has a higher learning curve than Datapad.</p><p>So as a beginner, if you're starting with Databox, you need to be patient for a week or two to understand Databox’s functioning. However, this isn't the case with Datapad.</p><p>Datapad comes with an easy-to-use interface allowing both technical and non-technical users to get the most out of their data.</p><p>Apart from the learning difficulties, there are certain aspects where Datapad has the upper hand over Databox. Let's get through them one by one.</p><h3>#1. Mobile Optimization</h3><p>Both Databox and Datapad mobile apps are available on Android and iOS stores. However, being accessible on both the web and the app, Databox fails to provide a wholesome pocket-friendly experience.</p><p>Here's what Nijo Daniel - one of Databox's mobile app users, has to say:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oaKEuUXMWnhVBvOzyQjo6Q51KDo.png""><p>On the other hand, Datapad is specifically designed and optimized for mobile-first users. The app provides a simple, straightforward, and seamless mobile interface.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eiqNOfMQckkaxdf9IMNNped7Qo.png""><p>Moreover, Datapad's intuitive mobile technology disowns it from bugs and glitches, which you often encounter while using Databox.</p><h3>#2. Team Onboarding</h3><p>Databox has some great team onboarding features like setting permissions but the process might become tedious. As the platform has a higher learning curve, it might take some of your time to get your team on board.</p><p>Infact, it becomes overwhelming when your subordinates have to go through the same learning process before actually assisting you on Databox.</p><p>However, that's not the case with Datapad. The platform's intuitive design and functionality makes the onboarding process a piece of cake with minimal expertise. This saves you ample training time and allows your team to focus on work as soon as they get on board.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, Datapad eases team communication throughout its platform. For example, you and your teammates can comment below a particular metric to get your thoughts out quickly.&nbsp;</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/t9rBqDFKCH7y22akPXPyjYt9s8U.png""><p>Datapad has an edge over Databox when it comes to onboarding team member, that’s because it lets you:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Set custom alerts and notifications regarding activities or trends in KPIs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Have seamless communication around complex metrics and KPIs with team members in real-time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Enable push notifications at regular intervals to stay updated with your KPIs and your team members’ performance</p></li></ul><h3>#3. Customizations</h3><p>Customizations are the most sought-after feature for any dashboarding software. Unfortunately, going through the drawback mentioned above, you might have figured out that customization isn’t a strong suit of Databox.</p><p>But it does a decent job.</p><p>With Datapad, you can easily customize texts, add widgets, change the colors of metrics, and create custom dashboards as you desire.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ekgX06Ma2Odj6bD1dd97cDsc4.png""><h3>#4. Data Import</h3><p>Importing data into a business intelligence solution like Databox is restricted due to the limited number of data sources it offers with its subscription plans.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, with Databox’s paid plan, you get access to just three data source connections initially. If you want more, you have to pay more.</p><p>This often leads to an unaffordable pricing policy for many <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/dashboard-software-for-small-business"">small businesses</a>, startups, and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>Moreover, even with the available data sources, the platform struggles to provide seamless import and export of crucial data.</p><p>Datapad, being a newcomer, has achieved ease of data import and export via multiple data sources and apis. Its well-built connectors (one-click integrations) help you import data to your Datapad dashboard effortlessly.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7kDIgbuboX7Zc2xdmfpX0b2OJhI.png""><p>Datapad also offers you to import data via its AI assistant (automatically) or manually.</p><p>With Datapad's robust data integration, you can easily:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Automate your import and export of data, or do it manually</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Easily customize your <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-dashboard-software"">KPI dashboards</a> to fit your data structure</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Create custom metrics from data imported from various data points and set achievable goals or milestones</p></li></ul><h3>#5. Integrations</h3><p>Another major differentiator between Databox and Datapad is their suite of integrations.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Databox owns the number of integrations (cloud-based and on-premise), it still fails to provide its users with access to some standard integrations. For example, integration to Google Sheets is only available with its paid plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Datapad gives you Google Sheets integrations and many others (Google Analytics, Shopify, Facebook Ads) for free.</p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Being in the market for a while now, Databox is a reliable business intelligence software, but why settle for less, if you can have more with other tools that more or less cost the same.</p><p>The Databox alternatives we mentioned in the article above are all tested, go ahead and try them out.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t want to give every alternative a try, we suggest you try out our mobile app - Datapad for free to create stunning databoards.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter if you're a startup, established SaaS brand, or an enterprise. We bet you won’t regret it!</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)&nbsp;</h2><h3>Q1.Is Datapad free?</h3><p>Yes, our tool is free to use. Since Datapad is in its beta testing phase, you can book a 1-1 onboarding call and try it out for free.</p><h3>Q2. How easy is it to get started with Datapad?</h3><p>Datapad is designed with a user-centric approach. That means it's best suited for non-technical as well as advanced users. In addition, it's an absolute no-code platform allowing anyone to get their hands working on the platform within minutes.</p><h3>Q3. Can I onboard my team?</h3><p>Yes, Datapad is very particular when it comes to team onboarding. Because we know there's no success without seamless team collaboration. With Datapad, you can quickly onboard your team, assign tasks, and monitor your team's performance from anywhere around the world.</p><p>‍</p>"

Easy Dashboard Creation&nbsp;</h4><p>With Datapad, custom dashboard creation is no big deal. You just need to choose a title, add a description, select an emoji (if you want) 😊 and create a dashboard.</p><img alt=""Datapad mobile dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ROggj4n3h3ySyXQT9ASbdUUv6c.gif""><p>Type in the KPIs you want to track, put a number (set your goal), define a time interval, and you are good to go.</p><p>Moreover, you can customize your KPI cards via pre-built graphs and pivot tables; change the metric colors to make them soothing to the eyes and in contrast to one another. Like the one below:</p><img alt=""datapad ecommerce dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/uHtmMINFhEH1YlmepFquipXcvk.jpeg""><p>Our app also allows you to take a bird-eye-view of all the metrics at once place.</p><p>You can also compare your past and present performances without additional effort. Besides, you get everything already curated for you on your dashboard.</p><p>Metrics you can track are not limited to marketing, you can track your whole business from Datapad to have a holistic view on what's going on.</p><h4>#2. Team Collaboration</h4><p>Team collaboration is a vital feature for any KPI tracking and dashboarding software out there. It can especially help SaaS companies who have a lot of data to track.</p><p>As Helen Keller said:</p><p><em>""Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much.""&nbsp;</em></p><p>Our team at Datapad loved the quote; hence, our tool is flawlessly optimized for you and your team to collaborate anytime and anywhere - all with a tap.</p><p>Datapad is trying to be like “Canva for metrics” because Canva made seign for everyone and we want to make “Data easy for everyone”</p><img alt=""datapad invite a user screen "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oD3Wv0dnLHN9qfuMpahcmFdhtI.gif""><p>With a single tap, you can easily:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>On-board your entire team</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Assign individual tasks to team members and goals to every KPI</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Enable discussions around metrics</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get real-time notifications and alerts</p></li></ul><p>We also ace at real-time collaboration like no other tool.</p><p>For example, suppose a specific metric is underperforming or needs attention. In that case, you can simply comment under the metric, tag the designated person, and have the metric looked over in real-time.</p><p>Likewise, your team can communicate under the KPIs to quickly broadcast messages.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DcFsXfNYPOLJQaXZtliJcj5uPls.gif""><p>Although Databox and Klipfolio have team collaboration features, none of them allows you to comment below metrics for instant communication like Datapad.</p><h4>#3. Mobile-Friendly Dashboards</h4><p>Now, all three tools have dedicated mobile apps. However, our tool is specially designed for mobile-friendly KPI tracking and dashboard creation. You may ask how.</p><p>Our mobile app is perfectly optimized for blazing fast performance. 📱&nbsp;</p><p>Thereby avoiding any lags, glitches, or delays in tracking your business performance.</p><p>Some of you could be using sheets or mobile apps of BI tools, but we know that these tools are not optimized for mobile experience, Datapad solves that problem for you.</p><p>There is no more excuse to not knowing what's happening in your business, whether you are in a beach in Thailand or in toilet you have full access to your metrics</p><img alt=""datapad mobile dashboard overview"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1iD1mpclopyNrRBi50ka9EBKOHk.gif""><p>It's compatible with all known mobile devices and small screen sizes, allowing you to view your complete dashboard no matter what the screen size.</p><p>In short, Datapad's mobile-friendly app allows you to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get instant access to important KPIs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Build mobile optimized dashboards (no double work for desktop)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Lightning-fast loading time and navigation across pages</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Powerful visualization tools with stunning graphics</p></li></ul><h4>#4. Automatic and Manual Data Entry</h4><p>Another sought-after feature of our tool is its automatic and manual data entry capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Datapad's one-click integrations allow you to transfer data from multiple sources into one unified dashboard within seconds.</p><img alt=""automatic data entry "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/KLEyZ57aUcKQqbAg53Cx6iqfSOI.gif""><p>Or, if you are unsure of tracking every data, you can manually input the data you want to monitor.</p><img alt=""manual data entry for dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1bfQMWCtcyAK2dDm9VxVlgtQB4Y.gif""><h3>Databox Features</h3><p>Even though all three tools share some common features, Databox is a better business analytics tool than the other two if we talk about the number of features. Although the quality of these features remains more or less the same.</p><p>‍</p><h4>#1. Highly Customizable Dashboards</h4><p>Comparatively, Databox offers more customization options than the other two tools. Its no-code dashboard easily allows you to pull in all your important metrics, visualize KPIs, and fully customize the look and feel of your dashboard within minutes.</p><img alt=""databox dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/VlJt0omF3RPdyVO5oN4af2oxE.jpeg""><p>Plus, its 200+ pre-built dashboard templates make it much easier for novice users to get started.</p><p>To add more, you can use its intuitive drag-and-drop feature to move, edit, or rearrange your dashboard without a single line of code.</p><p>You can even create custom metrics or calculate metrics, conversion rates, and ROI from multiple sources without coding or spreadsheets.</p><h4>#2. Team Collaboration</h4><img alt=""databox add a user"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wbZFJJXbgme74k7Pmz3bT4TlfaI.png""><p>Although Databox is a popular tool that offers a collaborative environment for teams and organizations, it doesn't effectively help your team to collaborate in real-time.</p><p>In this aspect, we find Datapad more convincing.</p><p>As with Datapad, you can easily comment under KPIs to follow up with your team members quickly.</p><p>On the other hand, Databox's team collaboration feature allows you to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Share daily, weekly, or monthly reports via Email, Slack, or as CSV</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get alerted when important KPIs trend up or down</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Schedule automated alerts for teams or specific departments</p></li></ul><p>Instant collaboration, however, cannot be something you can expect from Databox or Klipfolio.</p><p>Anyways, there's one feature that makes Databox stand out. It allows you to share performance and goals on TV.</p><p>This helps you to have your team focused on needle-moving activities and monitor performance while working on other tasks.</p><h4>#3. Mobile-Friendly Dashboards</h4><p>When it comes to being mobile-friendly, Datapad owns the category. However, Databox is not far behind the chase.</p><img alt=""databox mobile dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/geK66mZtY2wKnDEwl1lYy5psPjM.jpeg""><p>As per Databox, its mobile app is the foremost layer of the Databox platform and the most user-oriented tool in the suite. It provides instant business insights through an intuitive experience tailored for smartphones, tablets, and wearables.</p><p>Apart from the common features, Databox mobile app offers:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Mobile business intelligence dashboards that are as sophisticated as desktops</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Quick preview while creating dashboards on desktop</p></li></ul><p>But the major reason that Datapad has the upper hand in tracking KPIs via mobile apps is that you can't create a dashboard from your mobile on either Databox or Klipfolio app. You can just view KPIs, and that’s about it.</p><h4>#4. White-Labeling</h4><p>White-labeling allows you to personalize your reports and dashboards with your company branding - logos, color palette, etc. The features could come in handy for digital marketing agencies that send across KPI tracking reports to their clients.</p><p>This is one of the features that Datapad and Klipfolio don't offer.&nbsp;</p><p>With Databox's white-labeling feature, you can:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Personalize your dashboards and reports</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Choose a custom domain to share reports</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Brand mobile app with your logo</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Share reports via company emails</p></li></ul><h3>Klipfolio Features</h3><p>Klipfolio is a dashboard analytics platform that helps you track KPI with advanced features.</p><p>Let's compare Klipfolio's features with that of Datapad and Databox.</p><h4>#1. Dashboard Creation</h4><img alt=""Klipfolio dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/kypN2jiNNbUni1CILxffjQXUiUs.png""><p>Comparatively, Klipfolio has much more advanced options than the other two tools. It uses powerful formulas, functions, and data modeling to create highly customizable and pixel-perfect dashboards and reports.</p><p>It has 100+ pre-built Klip templates and 10+ dashboard templates that do half the job for you and your team. All you need to do is plug and play.</p><p>Unlike Datapad and Databox, Klipfolio offers advanced filtering features to its dashboard. Thereby allowing you to drill down your data effortlessly and visualize hidden metrics with ease.</p><p>Plus, it allows you to customize your dashboard's theme using CSS, which Datapad and Databox don't offer.</p><h4>#2. Mobile Optimization</h4><p>As we mentioned, all three tools have dedicated apps for their platform. But all three differ in some aspects.</p><p>Although we still feel that Datapad has an insanely driven app that counters all your business needs. Here's something to know:</p><p>Compared to Datapad, Klipfolio's mobile app UI/UX is not something to brag about. Below we have attached the screenshots to both Klipfolio and Datapad mobile applications so that you can judge it all by yourself.</p><p><strong>Datapad:</strong></p><img alt=""datapad mobile marketing dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/N577eWVdVuUz7Q39eZPMhNvDrQ.png""><p><strong>Klipfolio:</strong></p><img alt=""klipfolio mobile dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5prPwgRW7B8WFqpSoXYka7thvs.jpeg""><p>It's pretty evident that Datapad has a more user-friendly mobile app. It's simple, smooth, and attractive, with a lower-learning curve attached to it.</p><h4>#3. Automatic Data Input</h4><p>Klipfolio allows you to Upload an Excel file, import data via SQL connector, use pre-built REST/URL connectors, or update via email for automatic data input.</p><p>Comparatively, Datapad offers both automatic and manual data import. The feature not only eases your data import process but also lets control of data entirely into your hands.</p><p>On the other hand, with Databox, you can import data automatically via multiple data sources (but not manually).</p><p>Integrations, however, may play a significant role in the data importing capabilities of all three tools. So, below we have compared the integration supported by Datapad vs. Databox vs. Klipfolio.</p><div><br></div><h2>Datapad vs. Databox vs. Klipfolio Supported Integrations</h2><h3>Datapad</h3><p>Managing a successful business requires a dedicated team and tons of data. And hence, with Datapad, you get one-click integrations to multiple data sources and platforms. You can pull in all your data with ease from popular platforms, including:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Analytics</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Analytics</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Facebook Ads</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Sheets</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>SQL Server</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>MySQL</p></li></ul><p>We will soon launch other once-click integrations with top platforms like Shopify, Tableau, HubSpot, and more.</p><img alt=""datapad list of integrations"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/rWlNHnhSKulDZAmwmbIJtqwg.jpeg""><p>For the most part, our tool also allows you to input data manually. Although it's a tiring process, it's your data, so your choice.</p><h3>Databox</h3><img alt=""databox list of integrations"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nmBxyK1oenb00Eu5iwVYsYSAoE.png""><p>Databox, on the other hand, has 70+ one-click integrations (also has API). These integrations come with thousands of metrics, pre-configured Data Blocks, and over 200 pre-built reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of its key integrations include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Analytics</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>HubSpot CRM</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Facebook Ads</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Shopify and 70+ platforms</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, you can pull in data from any other sources by connecting to a SQL database or Google Sheets.</p><h3>Klipfolio</h3><img alt=""klipfolio list of integrations"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/NHeIZL1hOKEJWS0EmUqE9TH1Ew.png""><p>Lastly, Klipfolio has some great data connectors you can integrate and create dashboards. It allows you to import data via Excel file, pre-built REST/URLs, SQL connectors, or update data via automatic data input functionality.</p><p>Here're a few of its integrations:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Salesforce</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Microsoft Excel</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Instagram</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Facebook</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Analytics</p></li></ul><h3>Wrapping Up Integrations</h3><p>Unbiased opinion, Databox has its superiority reflected when it comes to integrations. However, at Datapad, we are constantly adding new integrations. You might as well request us for specific integrations via email that you need.</p><div><br></div><h2>Databox vs. Klipfolio vs. Datapad Pricing</h2><p>Now the most awaited question: How much do these tools cost? 💵</p><p>Well! A quick and soothing answer would be that Datapad is free from pricing boundaries. So the comparison remains between Databox and Klipfolio.</p><h3>Databox</h3><p>Databox has the most complex pricing model. Though, we tried to bring it all into a small summary.</p><p>The platform has a free-forever plan with three data sources and databoards each. Apart from this, Databox offers three plans, namely:</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The pricing below is based on the default number of connectors mentioned on Databox's website. In case you increase the number of connectors, the pricing changes accordingly.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Starter Pack:</strong> Daily monitoring and reporting of data (5 users; starting at $72/month)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Professional Pack:</strong> Hourly monitoring and analysis of data (25 users; starting at $135/month)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Performer Pack:</strong> On-demand monitoring (Unlimited users; starting at $231/month)</p></li></ul><img alt=""databox pricing page"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FW7cIFcAkZWlMu1LswLrB5nsUo.png""><h3>Klipfolio</h3><p>Klipfolio, on the other hand, has the simplest yet incomparable pricing data.</p><p>Unlike Databox, its plans are priced based on features and not the number of connectors.</p><p>However, here's how it is. Klipfolio offers its pricing models at two levels: Business and Enterprise.&nbsp;</p><p>For businesses, it has three plans to offer:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Grow: </strong>$142/month&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Team: </strong>$284/month</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Team+:</strong> $570/month</p></li></ul><img alt=""klipfolio pricing page"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/NmOwCq0RVUUc0N4XgsHyknFJI.png""><p>For the enterprise level, it has custom plans starting at $499/month.</p><img alt=""klipfolio enterprise pricing"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ehWpTfWc1v7iuJKyS881bj9dEk.png""><div><br></div><h2>What Are Customers Saying?</h2><p>So, this was our unbiased comparison of Datapad vs. Databox vs. Klipfolio. Now let's hear what customers have to say.</p><h3>Datapad&nbsp;</h3><p><em>I'm really impressed with the Datapad! It's so easy to use and keeps all my metrics and KPIs.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>The tracking features are really useful and the team management features are great.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>This is a really useful app that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay on top of their business. - Product Hunt</em></p><p>‍</p><img alt=""datapad customer revew from Product Hunt -1"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QVewGDTvaTsnZsxL6lJdJaBN8.png""><p><em>I had the privilege of being a beta user, and I'm impressed with how seamless the experience is. Especially for agencies when you ""need that number"" very often, it's essential to have a centralized experience for accessing your clients' KPIs and getting insights on performance in an instant.

Leading the investment was Pitchdrive, a renowned Belgian venture capital firm, with additional participation from prominent investors such as e2vc, Startup Istanbul, and several angel investors.</em></p><p>The experienced founding team, Cem Ruso (who exited Blutv to Time Warner) and Orkun Soylu (ex-Insider), saw firsthand how difficult it is to create KPI visibility and a truly data-driven culture using the existing complex analytics solutions.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Data is rapidly growing in size and complexity, making it incredibly tough, expensive, and time-consuming for an average business to build Business Analytics capabilities,”</em> said Ruso. <em>“We believe we can streamline and automate a majority of this process with autonomous AI agents. We basically want to take your data and tell you what’s working and what’s not.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Datapad supercharges human data analysts and decision-makers. Imagine you’re the CEO of a startup: you’ll be able to ask ad-hoc questions but also task the assistant to prepare scheduled periodic analyses for certain topics. The assistant will have a superhuman memory of all company historicals and will factor in external real-time context such as local holidays, competitor events, and industry benchmarks.</p><blockquote><p><em>“The new breed of productivity software is becoming increasingly conversational,”</em> Soylu added. <em>“That’s why we’re focusing on building assistants that will be able to take a ‘brief’ and act on it on a periodic basis. A CEO will be able to give a ‘task’ to the agent and receive an in-depth analysis sent to their inbox a minute later.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Although Datapad users interact with just one chat, in the background there is a huge AI team of marketing, SEO, conversion rate optimization, and business strategy expert agents that work together to build the best analyses possible. Essentially, the core value surpasses data analysis and enters the realm of strategic recommendations.</p><blockquote><p>Ruso emphasizes: <em>“There’s a tectonic shift happening with analytics, and we foresee that more than 70% of all analytics content will be AI-driven in the next couple of years. With this new funding, we strongly believe that we will be the key driver of this transformation.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Datapad shows its international ambitions with this VC round while growing its 100+ customer database from all around the world.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Cem and Orkun impressed us with their skills in building products people love. They found a very clear problem and turned the commodity that is AI today into an out-of-the-box solution. We can’t wait to see how Datapad will turn company analytics as we know it completely upside down.” - Koen, General Partner @ Pitchdrive VC</em></p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p><a href=""/"">Signup to the beta now →</a></p><p>Oh and, we're hiring :) →</p>"

Also, there’s little customization you can do with default visualizations.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Jzjfgrpne2u4ykmdWOtc1k427o.png""><h3>Reason 3.

It would help to see the schema like in other software such as Sisense or Salesforce.</p><p>On top of that, users feared renaming a field in a dataset would cause issues and might even break everything that was built.

That’s because Domo isn’t quite transparent about what it charges for the different tier plans it offers.</p><p>In such cases, it’s often hard to make a purchase decision, right? I feel you. I have faced the same issues in the past, and that’s why I’ve come up with a guide that has all the information about Domo’s pricing.</p><p>However, after reading the guide, if you feel that Domo isn’t the right fit for your business, we also have an alternative for you, which is an easy-to-use BI and data visualization tool.</p><p>Let’s start by knowing a little bit about what Domo has to offer.</p><h2>Domo Pricing Plans</h2><p>Domo offers a 4-tier pricing model which caters to businesses from small startups to large enterprises.</p><p>The platform's credit usage-based approach ensures that you only pay for the resources you utilize. This means no more hefty upfront costs or restrictive contracts.</p><p>Here are the Pricing Plans:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Free Trial: </strong>Lets you try out Domo for 30 days. Fully featured with unlimited users.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Standard: </strong>Perfect for teams with lower data volumes. Fully featured, unlimited number of users.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Enterprise: </strong>Built for organizations with higher data volumes and who prefer additional dedicated support.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Business Critical: </strong>For organizations requiring additional layers of security, scale, and volume.</p></li></ul><p>The tiered pricing model offers flexibility for businesses of varying sizes. But it's essential to look into the nuances of its pricing structure before choosing Domo.</p><h2>Domo Pricing Factors to Consider</h2><p>Domo’s pricing is simple but not so simple. Let me tell you what this means.</p><p>There are four things to consider:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Data Volume:</strong> The amount of data you ingest and process within Domo will directly impact your costs. Larger datasets and more complex data operations will consume more credits.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Credits:</strong> You buy a pool of credits up front, and as your team uses Domo's features, those credits get used up.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Features:</strong> The specific features you utilize will also influence your pricing. Advanced analytics, data governance, and machine learning capabilities are typically included in higher-tier plans.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Add-ons:</strong> Add-ons like dedicated support and professional training are priced separately.</p></li></ul><p>The pricing page says that the number of users accessing Domo will not affect your costs, meaning that you can have unlimited users using your account.&nbsp;</p><p>But what it doesn’t clearly say is more users will use more credits, and you will end up purchasing extra credits before your monthly credits refresh.</p><h3>How are Credits in Domo Used?</h3><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Storing Data:</strong> The amount of data you bring into Domo affects your credits. Bigger datasets require more credits to store and manage.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Crunching Numbers:</strong> Complex data analysis and calculations use more credits than simple tasks.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Advanced Features:</strong> Using features like data governance or machine learning costs more credits than basic reporting and visualization.</p></li></ul><p>Domo has different credit categories depending on how you store your data.</p><p>It's a bit technical, but basically, some credits are for specific ways Domo holds onto your data. Don't worry too much about the details for now – just remember the more data you store and the more complex things you do with it, the more credits you'll use.</p><p>Domo provides tools to monitor your credit usage so you can see how much you're spending and avoid any surprises.</p><p>Let’s now talk about the plans it offers.</p><h2>Domo Free Trial&nbsp;</h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/jETfoWhZiR22HQanbpm054jPgqo.png""><p>Before you commit to a Domo subscription, you will be offered a free trial to explore the platform.&nbsp;</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Free Self-Serve Education:</strong> You have access to a library of training materials, including 250 training modules, 2,000 knowledge base articles, and 240 educational videos.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>30 Days of Onboarding Support:</strong> A team of Domo experts will be available to help you get set up and answer any questions you have during your first 30 days.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>One Free Training Session:</strong> You can schedule a 45-minute, one-on-one consultation with a Domo expert.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Domo Standard Plan</h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RM0O4omZLaQrPnFuWM162n1gAqM.png""><p>This is Domo’s entry-level plan that offers great features that perfectly meet the needs of small- to medium-sized organizations.

So I don’t think there’s a problem with big organizations facing any problems affording Domo.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/10Tm8cnSgJdUWGEjBlUkOvU7oAI.png""><p>It might be helpful to assess your specific needs and budget to see if Domo aligns with your requirements.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Domo can be expensive compared to other data analytics platforms.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Some users find the cost to be a significant portion of their company's budget.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Others believe the value Domo offers outweighs the cost.</p></li></ul><p>Domo's pricing structure can be particularly challenging for small businesses with their limited budgets.</p><p>The credit consumption-based model leads to unexpectedly high costs. Especially if there’s a large volume of data you need to analyze monthly.</p><p>Similarly, organizations that handle large datasets frequently may face escalating expenses as their data processing and storage requirements increase.</p><p>We recommend carefully evaluating your data analytics needs and budget before making a decision.</p><h2>How Much Does Domo Actually Cost?</h2><p>There are no fixed prices listed on Domo's website, so it is difficult to say exactly how much it will cost. You will have to contact Domo’s sales team to get a quote that matches your requirements.</p><p>However, I did some digging and found some information related to Domo’s pricing.</p><p>The actual cost depends on the volume of data you process, the frequency of that processing, and any additional services you require.&nbsp;</p><p>The base user fee starts at $750 per user per year, as per an online review.

This will help you and your team identify the problem and rectify it instantly.</p></li></ul><p>Now that you know what a dynamic dashboard is in Google Sheets let's look at a tutorial you need to follow to create one.</p><h2>How to Build a Dynamic Dashboard in Google Sheets - Step-by-Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Import or Collect Data to Analyze</h3><p>The very first step in dynamic dashboard creation is to compile all the KPI-related data you want to track.</p><p>You can use a Google Form to collect data manually or import data from a data source like Google Analytics or as a CSV file.</p><p>If you choose to go by the route of Google Form, you can automatically convert the form into a Google Sheet and use the data to create a dynamic dashboard.</p><p>Here’s an image of a small set of data we will be using as an example to create a dynamic dashboard in Google Sheets.</p><img alt=""import or collect data for dynamic dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1rRTRy78grw2zDYGJscbTycheKA.png""><h3>Step 2: Elements You Should Know About When Creating Dynamic Dashboards</h3><p>When creating a dynamic dashboard in Google Sheets, there are several elements that you will use. Let’s first understand the functionality of these elements before creating a dashboard.</p><h4>#1. Pivot Table</h4><p>A pivot table gives you the summary of a large database you already created in Google Sheets. It helps you condense the data into aggregated form to extract and find the specific data range or sets you want.</p><p>For example, if you have an ecommerce store with multiple products.</p><p>A pivot table can help you identify the total revenue generated by a certain product in a certain location.</p><p>Essentially, pivot tables give you a birds-eye view of your raw data and help you understand it better.</p><p>With the current dataset (you can see the image in Step 1), let's say we want to know which sales channels were used the most over the year.</p><p>You can do that via a pivot table; here’s how:</p><img alt=""create pivot table for sheet"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/gDYsRb83yME9beata8kO00d4s.gif""><p><strong>Note: </strong>You can use Google Sheets formulas to derive insights like the example above, but pivot tables are much faster and easier to use. It also reduces the chances of human error and data inaccuracies.</p><h4>#2. Charts</h4><p>Charts are the most prominent feature of Google Sheets that you will be using when creating a dynamic dashboard.</p><p>They help you quickly analyze a large set of data via visual representation.</p><p>You can make charts from raw data as well as pivot tables as long as it has an X and a Y axis.</p><p>Here’s an example of a bar chart we created from our raw data.</p><img alt=""create chart in google sheets"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/UH9D7FKptdhByujce1z7vipw64.gif""><p>One great thing about these charts is that you can change your raw data and see the change in the chart immediately.</p><img alt=""sheets change raw data on bar chart"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/tEoRA0PEwoPbxHCTaQKXbLVmK4A.gif""><h4>#3. Slicer</h4><p>The slicer function of Google Sheets lets you ‘slice away’ data from a dataset, so you can focus on what’s important.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use the slicer feature for pivot tables, and they're also essential to keep control of the charts and graphs in your dynamic dashboard.</p><p>Here’s a little sneak-a-peek into the Slicer function. Setting the slicer up just takes seconds, and it can be a real help when you have a large dataset to analyze.</p><img alt=""google sheets slicing feature"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/YJ3WBNX1ntw7VJGL3XnyEYQ76Q.gif""><h4>#4. Lookup Formulas</h4><p>Lookup formulas help you find a specific value in a large set of data.</p><p>There are two types of Lookups:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Vertical Lookup (VLOOKUP): Finds the key value in the first column of a range that you define and returns a value from another column that’s in the same row.</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Horizontal Lookup (HLOOKUP): Same as vertical lookup, just horizontally.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Here’s an example of VLOOKUP in action:</p><img alt=""vlookup formula google sheets "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/C7FHdCxiBvNMwDIEpuwj2uweijY.gif""><p>The formula for VLOOKUP in Google Sheets goes like this:</p><p>=VLOOKUP(search_key, range, index, [is_sorter])</p><p>Where,</p><p>Search Key is the value of the search in the column.</p><p>Range is the upper and lower values to be considered for the search.</p><p>Index is the column number to search for value in (must be a positive integer).</p><p>Is_sorter is an optional input that you can choose:</p><p>Type true if you’ve sorted your data in any way,</p><p>And false if it’s unsorted.</p><h4>#5. Sparkline</h4><p>Sparkline helps you create a small line graph without any axes instantly. It can be helpful to analyze a data trend instantly.</p><p>Here’s how to make use sparkline formula on Google Sheets:</p><img alt=""create sparkline google sheets"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/iJPIIZY0fcKxQ96AmP1lH5bnCI.gif""><h4>#6. Conditional Formatting</h4><p>With conditional formatting, you can sort data in ascending or descending order, assign a color schema to data, and hide data that you don’t need.</p><p>It’s quite helpful when you have a specific goal assigned for a specific range of values.</p><p>The best use of conditional formatting is done when someone is doing keyword research.</p><p>One important metric to track when doing keyword research is keyword difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>With conditional formatting, you can set color schemes for different keywords.</p><p>One such color scheme could be:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Green for keywords with difficulty 0 to 29</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Yellow for keywords with difficulty&nbsp; 30 to 59</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Red for keywords with difficulty 60+</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><img alt=""conditional formatting google sheets"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/uGH7vgRM1Dw47YMi4HfMUzju4s.png""><h3>Step 3: Create Chart/Tables For Your Raw Data</h3><p>When it comes to dynamic dashboards in Google Sheets, charts and tables are your only option to track KPIs.</p><p>We say only, but they’re enough to track every KPI you can think of.</p><p>Let’s see how you can create a table to track KPIs via a dynamic dashboard.</p><p>From the raw data example, if you want to track the number of new users per month. You can select both columns and create a pivot table as we did in Step 2.</p><p>The same is true for charts.</p><p>With Google Sheets, you can create 8 types of charts:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Line charts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Column (Bar) charts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Combos</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Area charts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Pie charts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Scatter diagram</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Maps</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Miscellaneous charts</p></li></ol><img alt=""create chart or table on google sheets "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/qDI9QaXzFu7nnWVTvkkWUY2vc.png""><h3>Step 4: Use Data Validation Feature</h3><p>The data validation feature of Google Sheets is used to ensure that you only input a value in a column that's valid.</p><p>Let us explain it to you with an example.</p><p>Suppose there are 5 sales channels - A, B, C, D, and E, and we want to add those to our raw data sheet.</p><p>Data validation is the best way to ensure that you or your teammates don't add any other option in any of the cells apart from the 5 channels we mentioned above.</p><p>To do so, select the column you want to validate.</p><img alt=""data validation on google sheets "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ucCeYN2oj8RhcZ8aUlhP5jnq7E.png""><p>Go to Data in the menu and click on <strong>‘Data Validation.’</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>You will see a data validation window open, like the one below.</p><img alt=""data validation google sheets "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/sDb1bfVN9wkx33wct3xPN8LiI.png""><p>In the Criteria option, change <strong>‘List from a range’</strong> to <strong>‘List of items’</strong> and write the five channel names separated by commas.</p><img alt=""data validation choose list of items"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/S1Bz2Ts4CQLA8crRZ3rqx1aPQzw.png""><p>Click on <strong>Save</strong> after you’re done.</p><p>You will now see a drop-down in the column named<strong> ‘Sales Channel’ </strong>from which you can select the channel for each month.</p><img alt=""data validation feature"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1n1AZMi3hIDOneWe2MyMvB09KDM.gif""><h3>Step 5: Formatting and Customization</h3><p>Formatting and customization can be done for both raw data and the charts you make to track KPIs via a dynamic dashboard.</p><p>For formatting the raw data, you can use conditional formatting. You can see how to do it in Step 2 of this guide.</p><p>When it comes to formatting charts, Google Sheets has an array of features.</p><img alt=""sheets formatting and customization"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DiDNpFOspFWN3Sv7IRPKQLCIWOI.png""><p>Here’s what you can do with the formatting options for charts:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Select the graph type you want for your KPI from multiple options</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Change the color and font of the chart</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Change the axes titles or flip the axes if required</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Insert error bars, data labels, or trend lines if needed</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Introduce a legend axis</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Enables gridlines and ticks on the charts&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3>Step 6: Convert all the Charts into a Dynamic Dashboard</h3><p>To make a dynamic dashboard in Google Sheets, you must publish the charts onto a webpage.</p><p>To do so, open a new sub sheet and copy and paste all the charts on it.</p><img alt=""convert charts to dynamic dashboards"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hMlNfQYJpJwc0eWQsthR2yiT9TI.png""><p>After that, go to File &gt; Share &gt; Publish to Web.</p><img alt=""publish charts"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ssCvS7SijYP6muW4YFFQfadHI.gif""><p>A small window will pop up on the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of the <strong>‘Entire document’</strong> option, choose <strong>‘All Charts’</strong> from the drop-down menu and click <strong>Publish</strong>. Copy the link and paste it into a new Google tab.</p><img alt=""sheets publish dashboard to public"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5RZyeEO6vSiKht1x83RLnAYaeo.gif""><p>Here’s your dynamic dashboard that you can share with your teammates.</p><h2>Drawbacks of Creating Dynamic Dashboards in Google Sheets&nbsp;</h2><h3>#1. Your Dashboard Can Easily be Ruined by Someone Else</h3><p>Keeping track of business KPIs via a dynamic dashboard on Google Sheets is great if you’re an individual doing all the heavy lifting. But if you have a team to help you out track KPIs, Google Sheets can be your new nightmare.</p><p>Especially if some teammates of yours are complete beginners to KPI tracking.&nbsp;</p><p>They might change a few things in a dashboard to test the waters, and there are chances it'll completely ruin your dashboard.</p><p>Also, there's always a risk of sharing the sheet accidentally with someone outside your organization, leading to data leaks.</p><h3>#2. No Mobility</h3><p>The mobile experience of Google Sheets isn't great; you have to scroll both horizontally and vertically to look at your KPIs. Apart from this, it's also very tough to edit something on Google Sheets via a mobile phone.</p><p>Our suggestion is, don’t rely too much on Google Sheets for your dashboards when you need quick access.</p><p>What happens if you need to check specific data in your investor meeting when they ask you to?</p><p>You can’t just sit there firing up a laptop and taking your own time to give them an answer.</p><h3>#3. It’s Hard to Maintain a Dashboard on Sheets</h3><p>Google Sheets dynamic dashboards are a decent option for just getting started with KPI tracking, which means that it's great to track a handful of KPIs (5 or 6).&nbsp;</p><p>But due to a lot of manual procedures, tracking multiple KPIs will take a lot of time.&nbsp;</p><p>When your company grows, you will have multiple departments tracking a bunch of KPIs separately.</p><p>Maintaining Google Sheets dashboards is tough at that point in time, and also, with so much data loaded in the Google Sheets, it becomes slow.</p><p>There might come a point where the time taken by the dashboard to load will be more than the time required for you and your team to track KPIs, and you can't afford such a waste of time when you have to track KPIs almost every day.</p><h2>Solution: Keep Track of All Your Key Metrics in One Place for Free with Datapad</h2><p>With the above dynamic dashboard in Google Sheets, it's quite evident that you can't track KPIs on the go.</p><p>But there must be some app that lets you do it, right? 🤔</p><p>And there is!</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eyY2EqHqnnwehgO83zVOJie4M2A.png""><p>Datapad is designed to make data analysis easier, especially for those using Google Sheets.

But for that, your dashboard must tune in with the right set of KPIs to deliver the best results.</p><p>For the most part, ecommerce KPIs should be measurable, quantifiable, and capable of providing actionable insights about your store's performance. In addition, they should answer questions about the current state of your business to help you make informed decisions.</p><p>For example, a Sales KPI should derive the total sales generated, the sources of revenue, a comparison between predicted and actual sales, and ways to improve sales.</p><p>Likewise, several other KPIs are used to build a comprehensive ecommerce KPI dashboard.</p><p>But the question you might have in your mind is - how can you figure out a good KPI for your dashboard?</p><p>A good KPI is a blend of the following attributes:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Simple</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Relevant</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Aligned</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Actionable</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Measurable</p></li></ul><p>Now that you know the basics of ecommerce KPI dashboards and how to identify good KPIs for it, let’s walk through the importance of an effective dashboard for your online store.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Is It Important to Track Ecommerce KPIs?</h2><p>With over 2.14 Bn expected online shoppers and 2.9 trillion dollars worth of sales in 2021, ecommerce analytics can be a deal-breaker for your online store.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eZkUUeHvUMYFqkzQNa7kZxkJzM.png""><p><a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/"">Source</a></p><p>What if tens and thousands of people visit your store but don’t complete the purchase cycle for one of the many reasons?</p><p>Or, what if your loyal customers start switching to your competitors due to a lack of personalization you have in your store?</p><p>You have the data but neither you have any idea what to do with it, nor you have a magic wand to view and transform raw data into actionable and deeper insights.</p><p>Luckily, you have a wand (two in fact 😉) you didn't know about - KPIs and Metrics.</p><p>Now, while&nbsp; ecommerce metrics can help you analyze data and gain in-depth valuable insights into daily business operations, KPIs can help you track the progress of these metrics towards long-term goals and objectives.</p><p>With <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">KPIs and metrics </a>you get a clear understanding of your wrong doings and therefore you can tweak your online business strategy based on data-driven decisions.</p><p>But most importantly, the insights generated from ecommerce KPIs can be helpful in educating and training your sales and marketing teams. Thereby improving the overall performance of your ecommerce business.</p><p>Eventually, an ecommerce KPI dashboard can help you pump millions of dollars into your account, but only if you know the right ones to keep track of.</p><h2>What are the Most Common Ecommerce KPIs to Track?&nbsp;</h2><h3>Metric #1. Customer Acquisition Cost</h3><p>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) measures the cost related to acquiring a customer. You can measure it by analyzing your marketing spend and how it breaks down per customer.&nbsp;</p><p>The lower your acquisition cost, the better.</p><p>Here's how you can do that:</p><p><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost =</strong> Cost Spent on Acquiring Customer / Number of Customers Acquired</p><p>For example, in Q1 of 2022, Tim invested $1000 in marketing for his online shoe store. As a result, he was able to acquire 50 new customers.</p><p>CAC = $1000/ 50 = $20</p><p>Therefore, Tim's CAC for the Q1 was $20.</p><p>This metric helps you improve your return on investment by figuring out the most cost-effective way of acquiring new customers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> For a profitable ecommerce store, the average order value should always be greater than the cost per acquisition.</p><h3>Metric #2. Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate</h3><p>Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate (CAR) is the percentage of visitors adding products to the chart but, for some reason, end up not purchasing them.&nbsp;</p><p>You would rate this as the #1 KPI to measure if we say that, on average, around 69.57 percent of customers worldwide abandon shopping carts (more than half the traffic visiting your store).</p><p>To calculate CAR use this formula:</p><p><strong>Cart Abandonment Rate = </strong>1- (Total Number of Successful Purchases / Total Number of Shopping Carts Created) x 100</p><p>By running retargeting ads for these cart abandoners, you have a high chance of hooking them back to the checkout process.</p><p>Try luring them with mind-boggling offers, personalized emails, or anything that persuades them to re-open your website and complete the purchase.</p><h3>Metric #3. Average Order Value</h3><p>The Average Order Value (AOV), also known as the Average Market Basket, is the average amount of money customers typically spend on one single order.&nbsp;</p><p>Calculation of this ecommerce KPI is pretty straightforward:</p><p><strong>Average Order Value = </strong>Total Revenue / No. of orders</p><p>Now, why is it an important KPI to track?</p><p>Identifying the purchasing power of your customers can let you set benchmarks for them. You can get shoppers to buy more products than they planned for.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few ideas to get started:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Up-sell or cross-sell products</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Set discounts like 'Buy 3 Get 1 Free or 'Buy 3 get 30% discount’</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Offer free shipping after a specific bill amount</p></li></ul><h3>Metric #4 Customer Retention Rate</h3><p>Customer Retention Rate (CRR) represents the rate at which customers buy from you repeatedly over time. Generally speaking, it helps you identify your recurring customers.</p><p>The formula to calculate CRR goes like this:</p><p><strong>Customer Retention Rate = </strong>(A - N) / E x 100</p><p>Where:</p><p><strong>A</strong> = Number of Customers at the End of a Period</p><p><strong>N </strong>= New customer added during the period</p><p><strong>E</strong> = Total number of existing customers at the beginning of the period</p><p>Identifying your recurring customer is important because these customers spend <a href=""https://www.business.com/articles/returning-customers-spend-67-more-than-new-customers-keep-your-customers-coming-back-with-a-recurring-revenue-sales-model/"">67%</a> more than new customers.</p><p>Plus, the success rate of selling to an existing customer is <a href=""https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/"">60-70%</a>, while the success rate of selling to a new customer is only 5-20%.</p><p>Either way, this KPI can help you increase profitability and build customer loyalty simultaneously. The average CRR of the ecommerce industry is 30%. However, the more, the better.</p><h3>Metric #5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)</h3><p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is the degree of measurement of the revenue generated from individual customer’s over their relationship with the company.&nbsp;</p><p>To calculate CLV use this formula:</p><p><strong>CLV =</strong> (Average Order Value x Number of Annual Purchases Made by the Customer x The Average Length of Customer Relationship in years)</p><p>Comparing CLV to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) lets you figure out the profitability of each customer.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose a customer spends $100 every time he visits your ecommerce store. He visits the website twice every month (24 times per year) and has been doing that for the past five-years.</p><p>The shop owner can find its CLV by the following formula:</p><p><strong>CLV = </strong>100 x 24 x 5 = $12,000</p><p>The CLV for that particular customer is $12,000</p><h3>Metric #6. Churn Rate</h3><p>In general terms, the churn rate is the rate at which customers leave your brand in a given period.</p><p>Here's how you track your fleeing customers:</p><p><strong>Churn Rate =</strong> (B - E) / B x 100</p><p>Where:</p><p><strong>B </strong>represents the no. of customers at the beginning</p><p><strong>E </strong>represents the number of customers in the end</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To calculate the annual churn rate multiply the formula by 12.</p><p>Churn Rate is an important ecommerce metric as it helps you identify the percentage of existing customers willing to abandon your store. In addition, this data can be further used for customer retention purposes.</p><p><strong>Industry Tip:</strong> Customer retention cost is 5X cheaper than customer acquisition cost.</p><h3>Metric #7. Net Promoter Score</h3><p>The Net Promoter Score KPI is an ecommerce metric that gives you insights into how many customers are willing to recommend your products to others.</p><p>The formula to calculate Net Promoter Score is:</p><p><strong>Net Promoter Score = </strong>%Promoters - %Detractors</p><p>Where,</p><p>Promoters are the segment of people who are likely to recommend your products. In contrast, Detractors are the unhappy customers who won't recommend you to anyone.</p><p>Tracking NPS will give you a clear understanding of your business regarding <a href=""https://www.omnisend.com/blog/how-to-measure-customer-satisfaction/"">customer satisfaction</a> and brand loyalty.</p><h3>Metric #8. Product Return Rate</h3><p>The Product Return Rate KPI derives the percentage of sale orders that have a product return.</p><p>We can segment PRR into three categories:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Return Orders</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Refunded Orders</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Exchange Orders&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>To calculate the above metrics you can just divide them with the total orders placed at the same time.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>To calculate the percentage, divide each of the metrics by 100.</p><p>If your PRR is high, that means you're unable to fulfill customer expectations from your product or services.</p><p><strong>Industry Fact:</strong> The average ecommerce return rate is <a href=""https://apprissretail.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/AR3020-2020-Customer-Returns-in-the-Retail-Industry.pdf"">18.1%</a>; anything below this percentage is a well-to-do return rate for your store.&nbsp;</p><h3>Metric #9. Conversion Rate</h3><p>Conversion Rate in ecommerce determines the rate at which potential customers, or as we may say, website visitors, are converting into actual current customers.</p><p>Here's how you can figure it out:</p><p><strong>Conversion Rate = </strong>(Total Number of Website Visitors / Total Number of Conversions) x 100</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The data collected on the number of visitors and the number of conversions should have the same timeframe.</p><p>Conversion Rate isn't just a buzzword. With your store's conversion rate know-how, you are one step closer to becoming a six figure ecommerce store owner.</p><p>Conversion rate optimization can immensely help you convert more visitors into customers by measuring the performance of your store, marketing campaigns, and marketing strategies.</p><h3>Metric #10. Cost of Goods Sold</h3><p>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is the overall cost incurred on the goods before the sale has been made. For example, manufacturing costs, employee costs, overhead costs, etc.</p><p>To calculate COGS, you need four data pieces:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Initial Inventory value&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Product-related direct and indirect costs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Additional inventory Purchased (if any)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Ending Inventory Volume</p></li></ul><p>And then, use this formula to derive your COGS:</p><p><strong>Cost of Goods Sold = </strong>Beginning Inventory + (Purchase Costs + Labor Costs + Materials Costs + Supplies Costs + Miscellaneous Costs) - Ending Inventory</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since GOGS plays a vital role in calculating Gross Profit, any error in its calculation will hamper the results from other metrics in the chain.</p><h3>Metric #11. Gross Profit</h3><p>Gross Profit is one of the most important metrics to measure the performance of your online store. It shows you your business's total profit after deducting all possible costs incurred in production and distribution.</p><p>Here's an easy formula to calculate the most crucial metric:</p><p><strong>Gross Profit = </strong>Total Cost of Goods Sold / Total Amount of Sales</p><p>COGS and sales should lie under the same timeframe. Plus, the higher the Gross Profit, the higher the revenue and vice versa.</p><h3>Metric #12. Revenue Per Visitor</h3><p>Ecommerce companies use Revenue Per Visitor (RPV) to measure the amount of revenue your business generates each time a customer visits your website.</p><p>Here's how to figure it out:</p><p><strong>RPV =</strong> Revenue / Visitors</p><p>For example, if your revenue from August to November is $50,000 and your site receives 5,00 visitors during the quarter, your RPV would be</p><p>Revenue Per Visitor (RPV) = $50,000 / 500 or $100.</p><p><strong>Industry Jargon:</strong> RPV helps you gather in-depth insights about your user behavior, which some other key metrics, such as Conversion Rate and Average Order Value (AOV), can't answer.</p><h3>Metrics #13. Inventory Turnover Ratio</h3><p>This ecommerce KPI acts as a financial ratio that helps store owners measure the number of times their inventory is completely sold in a given time period.</p><p>Most importantly, the Inventory Turnover Ratio helps you understand how well you are turning your inventory into sales or if your business has excess inventory compared to its overall sales.</p><p>Here's how to calculate ITR:</p><p><strong>Inventory turnover = </strong>Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory for the Same Period</p><p>The ratio also helps you predict the amount of inventory to be purchased based on past online sales. Thereby keeping a balance between inventory and order volume so you never run out of stock.</p><h2>How to Set Up An Ecommerce Metric Dashboard in 5 Steps?</h2><p>For this step by step guide, let’s show you how you can track ecommerce KPIs via Datapad.</p><h3>Step 1: Define Your Goal</h3><p>Before we get started with the dashboard, it's important to decide which ecommerce KPIs you should track.</p><p>To get started, find answers to questions like, ""What outcomes are you expecting from your dashboard?""</p><p>Try to define your business goals and KPIs around these four factors:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Relevance to your business performance</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Accountability for every activity</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The required frequency of measurement</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Supported by all executives in the organizational pyramid</p></li></ul><h3>Step 2: Setup a Dashboard</h3><p>Open the Datapad app and tap on set up your account by signing up.

Gauge Your Email Performance</h4><p>When you use email marketing KPIs, you better understand the why and how of your emails. </p><p>For example, </p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How does the person interact with email? </p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Have they opened it or not? </p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How many responded to it? </p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Why is your email list not growing?</p></li></ul><p>And many more…</p><p>As per <a href=""https://www.litmus.com/blog/2021-state-of-email/"">Litmus</a>, 37% of brands are increasing their email budgets. That means measuring your email marketing strategy’s performance is of significant importance.</p><p>Moreover, you can analyze how your email campaigns are performing by measuring certain KPIs such as open rate, conversion rate, and revenue per subscriber. Thereby identifying the weaker sections and working to improve them.</p><h4>#2. Improve Communication With Customers</h4><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/OeMNebbTqo4k94yyKpojeVdA8.png""><p><a href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/the-state-of-small-business-marketing/"">Source</a></p><p>With <a href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/the-state-of-small-business-marketing/#one"">64% of small businesses</a> using emails to reach customers, Emails have become a convenient medium of communication between businesses and customers.</p><p>Sure, there are newer ways of connecting, like social media channels, but which of them offers you direct communication with 4.5 billion people?</p><p>Email marketing KPIs lets you personalize your relationship with customers.

Get a Better ROI</h4><p>Email marketing accounts for an impressive ROI of<a href=""https://www.litmus.com/resources/email-marketing-roi/""> $36 for every dollar spent</a>. But that's achievable only if you curiously analyze your email marketing performance.</p><p>You must have the proper email marketing KPIs to get close to the mentioned ROI – a set of measurable indicators that can furnish you with data-driven insights and actionable feedback.</p><p>Some key performance indicators like revenue per subscriber, subscriber lifetime value, and list growth rates are the most important ones that directly impact your ROI for email marketing.</p><p><strong>Food For Thought:</strong> How can you calculate these KPIs, and why should you?</p><p>Below we have curated a list of the 13 best email marketing KPIs that every marketer should track.</p><h2>13 Email Marketing KPIs Every Marketing Professional Should Track</h2><h3>#1. Clickthrough Rate</h3><p>Clickthrough rate refers to the total number of people who clicked on one or multiple links you sent via email.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Clickthrough rate is quite a buzz among marketing professionals. It's like the day-to-day marketing metric to them. Moreover, it's easy to calculate the CTR for every individual email you send.</p><p>Measuring the number of clicks on links contained in every mail gives meaningful insights, such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Are your customers actually reading the email?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>If they’re reading it, which part of the email entices them the most?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What links are they clicking?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Are customers clicking on a link placed at a particular position?</p></li></ul><p>The average clickthrough rate swings between <a href=""https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-the-average-click-and-read-rates-for-email-campaigns/#:~:text=If%20you%20look%20at%20industry,be%20between%206%2D17%25."">2-5%</a>, but that's an industry average, so you can always go beyond it.</p><p>Once you get the answers led by data, you can tune your marketing strategies and structure your emails correctly.</p><p>Here's how to calculate CTR:</p><img alt=""ctr formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/uIDcn7mmySkiUbD3bfFiGVvWU.png""><h3>#2. Bounce Rate</h3><p>The bounce rate reflects the percentage of emails that failed to get delivered to the recipient's inbox.</p><p>Generally, <strong>'bounces'</strong> are classified into two categories: Hard bounces and Soft bounces.</p><p>Soft bounces occur due to temporary reasons such as the full inbox of the recipient or a technical glitch on the hosting platform. However, these are temporary and are resolved over time.</p><p>Hard bounces, on the other hand, are the result of three factors:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Invalid email address</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Closed email</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Non-existent email address</p></li></ul><p>It's pretty clear which bounce rate affects your marketing - the hard bounces. And so, marketers stay focused on monitoring their hard bounce rates. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) take bounce rates as a measure to determine an email sender's reputation. Once your bounce rate triggers ISPs, your email may land on the list of spammers of your service provider.</p><p>Higher the number of bounded emails, less is your conversion, thus less is your ROI.</p><p>This might leave your email blocked or, worse, blacklisted.</p><p>Another thing to consider here, this metric also tells you a whole different story about your email list.</p><p>The hard bounces indicate that you’re targeting the wrong audience, and it's time to refresh your email list.</p><p>Here's a quick formula to calculate bounce rate:</p><img alt=""bounce rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mofcBE7Iyg3GaJH1UIsK6T4wsKc.png""><p><strong>Note:</strong> Marketers consider an average bounce rate of 2% as good.</p><h3>#3. Email Open Rate</h3><p>Open rate is measured as the number of times an email is opened vs. the number of emails successfully delivered.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This metric is among the most initial ones that email marketers measure. But you might be unaware that the open rate doesn't actually mean the number of times your email is opened. There's a bit of technical jargon here.</p><p>Whenever you send an email, it's embedded with an invisible image. As soon as a subscriber opens your email, the said image automatically gets downloaded, and the email is counted as open. But here's the thing.</p><p>As of today, almost everyone has enabled image blocking. So even if a customer opens your email, it's not counted in.</p><p>Unfortunately, that makes this metric inaccurate and unreliable for measuring performance. However, the open rate can significantly help you in competitive analysis. </p><p>Suppose you want to compare the open rate of current vs. last week's campaign. Open rate is always beneficial in figuring out if your email headlines are pursuing customers to open your emails or not.</p><p>Here's how you calculate the open rate:</p><img alt=""email open rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ddaDlXz42fMfIXW03cIXq2p8CTQ.png""><h3>#4. Email Deliverability</h3><p>Till now, you might have noticed that we’re talking about the number of emails delivered and not the emails sent. </p><p>That's because sometimes, even after sending the emails, they automatically bounce back from the receiver's server. Or get dropped in their spam folders without them knowing about it.</p><p>Deliverability Rate is the measure of successfully delivered emails (that land in recipients' inboxes) vs. the total number of emails sent.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The deliverability rate ensures that your brand's message reaches your target audience. It often happens that after you press send, your emails might not get delivered due to hard or soft bounces or due to reasons such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Not having an unsubscribe button </p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Sending bulk mails</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Using a free-domain email address </p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Having a weak domain authority</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, your delivery rate tells you what fraction of your email list is actually authentic and can be carried forward for marketing purposes.</p><p>For the most part, a deliverability rate of <a href=""https://www.omnisend.com/blog/email-deliverability/"">95% or more</a> is considered reasonable by marketing professionals.</p><p>Use this quick formula to calculate the deliverability rate:</p><img alt=""email deliverability formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/spjgd1JlSiaEKgxgTKNTkehQiG8.png""><h3>#5. Unsubscribe Rate</h3><p>The unsubscribe rate is the measure of the percentage of people that unsubscribed from your emails over a period of time.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The unsubscribe rate directly impacts your deliverability, i.e, a higher unsubscribe rate results in a lower deliverability rate and vice versa.</p><p>There can be many reasons for users unsubscribing from your emails. However, here're a few things you can do to reduce the unsubscribe rate:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Plan your content</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Test different email frequencies (daily/weekly/occasionally)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Perform segmentation of your email list</p></li></ul><p>Like open rates, this KPI is also beneficial in comparative analysis. For example, you can measure the unsubscribe rate of the current month with the previous month for internal evaluation of marketing efforts.</p><p>To calculate the unsubscribe rate, all you have to do is divide the total number of unsubscribes with the number of emails sent.</p><img alt=""unsubscribe rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FGDc1tkUUhGDbH4hMHF4xulFaQ.png""><p><strong>Note: </strong>Removing the unsubscribe button from your emails is not a wise move. It may increase the chances of our email landing in the spam folder of recipients.</p><h3>#6. Conversion Rate</h3><p>Conversion rate determines the percentage of subscribers who took a series of actions after opening your emails. From clicking a link to purchasing a product - whatever your final conversion goal was.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Unlike other email marketing metrics that are directed towards your email marketing success, this metric leverages your business success as a whole.</p><p>In other words, it reflects how effectively your emails convert leads into customers.</p><p>For example, if your email's call-to-action (CTA) was downloading a book, the number of subscribers who opened your email, clicked the link, and downloaded the book are counted as conversions.</p><p>Here's a quick formula to calculate the conversion rate:</p><img alt=""conversion rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/9MWVBrVuRo6qs7dUFIZKbxNxEgY.png""><p>Higher the conversion rate, better the performance of your email campaigns.</p><h3>#7. Share and Forward Rate</h3><p>Share and forward rate refers to the number of times your email has been shared or forwarded. Emails have <strong>‘share’</strong> and <strong>‘forward’</strong> buttons, and this KPI measures the number of times recipients have clicked it over a period of time.</p><h4>Why is it important?</h4><p>This metric is important because it gives an idea of the virality of your content. Mostly, a subscriber sharing a content piece is like word-of-mouth marketing for your business.</p><p>Moreover, tracking this metric allows you to identify the type of content that’s popular and pave your way towards creating more such content.</p><p>Here's how you calculate the forward and share rate:</p><img alt=""share and forward rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/8tC4gwzl7Hcpzhm6TsdkJR6Eb0.png""><h3>#8. Event Lag</h3><p>Event lag measures the time it takes to get the first click from the time when the email was delivered. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Measuring event lag lets you understand how your content resonates with your subscribers. For example, what are they clicking on? How long does it take to react to your call-to-action?</p><p>Event lag also demonstrates the effectiveness of your email preheaders, subject lines, and body content. It shows how your email structure and use of words drive customers to quickly open your email or let them languish in their inboxes.</p><p>To calculate event lag, simply subtract the time taken for the first desired action from when the email was delivered.</p><h3>#9. Email ROI</h3><p>Email ROI is the overall return on investments for the money spent on email marketing campaigns. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Return on investment is a crucial metric for marketers. It tells whether their marketing efforts can cover the cost incurred and, in surplus, make them enough money to carry forward operations.</p><p>In this case, the average ROI of email marketing is <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/best-practices/email-marketing-tools/"">3,800%</a>, while it can be as high as 4400%. That's $44 for every dollar spent.</p><p>Hence, measuring this metric is vital for both your email marketing success and your business’s success as a whole.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate ROI:</p><img alt=""Email ROI formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/58x03Y23rNo8zhPBMFhb5Ern04.png""><h3>#10. Spam Rate</h3><p>Spam complaints add negativity to your email marketing efforts. It measures the number of people who reported your email as spam. This number increases if several people find your email subject or content irrelevant.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Spam complaints are the results of many factors such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>When you acquire an email list from third-party (the subscriber are unaware of who you are)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Sharing irrelevant content (the subscribers don't want to see your content)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Higher frequency of emails (sending too many emails in a short span)</p></li></ul><p>According to marketing professionals, the acceptable spam complaint rate is <a href=""https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000150570-How-to-reduce-a-high-spam-complaint-rate#:~:text=The%20industry%20acceptable%20standard%20spam,major%20inbox%20providers%20like%20Gmail."">0.01%</a>. Anything above that is a matter of concern.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the spam rate</p><img alt=""spam rate fomula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/CHyS52cyrr2zvYVLTwg7eQxqw.png""><h3>#11. List Growth Rates</h3><p>The list growth rate, as the name depicts, is the rate at which your email list grows over time.</p><p>This metric is important for marketers as an increase in this KPI shows a positive sign towards increasing reach, popularity, and rightful email marketing efforts.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This KPI tells marketers how many new email subscribers they have added to their email list. You can use some strategies to increase this KPI, such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Give discounts in exchange for emails</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Use lead magnets (E-books, webinars, and more) to collect emails </p></li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>Avoid purchasing email lists from third-party providers. It might grow your email list, but the overall performance of your email marketing campaigns would remain stagnant or decrease with time.</p><p>To calculate the email list growth rate, use this simple formula:</p><img alt=""list growth rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/MTlzCvdBZRtgdPuYTFj9fet4I.png""><h3>#12. Revenue Per Email or Subscriber</h3><p>Revenue per subscriber is the total revenue generated from individual subscribers in your email list. This KPI typically shows you the performance of each email.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This KPI is the email version of the average revenue per user (ARPU). </p><p>Revenue per subscriber is linked to your return on investment in email marketing. Therefore, marketers find this metric unique and use the insights to optimize their email campaigns.</p><p>Here's a quick formula to calculate revenue per subscriber:</p><img alt=""revenue per subscriber formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/meSDFhueMvUCsBL519clI2CsYCE.png""><p>For example, if an email campaign generated $1000 and you sent 100 emails, the revenue per subscriber will be $10.</p><h3>#13. Subscriber Lifetime Value </h3><p>Subscriber lifetime value depicts the amount of money subscribers spend before they unsubscribe, delist, or become inactive from your email list.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Just as revenue per subscriber, subscriber lifetime value helps marketers measure their return on investments for email marketing. </p><p>Moreover, marketers follow this metric to ensure that their cost-per-subscriber stays below the subscriber lifetime value for a positive return on investments.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate subscriber lifetime value:</p><img alt=""subscriber lifetime value formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZlGvY4hjTPyIC6ctZbtKApNaAI.png""><p>Now that you know what KPIs you need to measure, it’s time to create a unified dashboard to measure everything under one roof.</p><h2>How to Create Email Marketing KPI Dashboard in Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad homepage"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/n3Cf1JpSJmYZUbrMGpLZyWzWaPY.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a mobile-friendly dashboarding tool that unifies all your email marketing KPIs into one dashboard and allows you to perform data visualizations from your mobile phones themselves.</p><p>Here's how easy it is to create an email marketing KPI dashboard in Datapad.</p><h3>Step 1: Create your Email Marketing KPI Dashboard</h3><p>Our app is available for both iOS (App Store) and Android (Play Store) devices.

It lets you automate most of your dashboard creation process, thus saving you time.</p></li></ul><h2>What is an Excel Dashboard?&nbsp;</h2><p>An Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of KPIs and metrics using easy-to-understand data visualization elements.</p><p>These elements generally constitute graphs, pie charts, cohorts, tables, and interactive widgets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In simple words, Excel dashboards are visual representations of large data tracks. It can help you create Static and Dynamic dashboards.</p><p>The only hindrance is, you should know how to use Excel to the fullest! Or else, this is how you will find yourself with Excel:</p><img alt=""computer with a lot of charts"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RdhwGwu9xEheEakIYq3zMblpWkY.gif""><p>Below we have curated a step-by-step guide on creating a full-fledged dashboard on Excel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Although creating dashboards in Excel involves a heavy amount of manual work, it's worth the effort.</p><p>So, take a chill- 💊, be patient 🧘🏻‍♂️, and let's go.</p><h2>How to Create a Dashboard in Excel?&nbsp;</h2><p>Here’s a 5-step Excel dashboard tutorial you need to create dashboards in Excel as fast as possible.</p><h3>Step 1: Build Your Database</h3><p>Like there's no Hogwarts without Hagrid, there's no Dashboard without Data.</p><img alt=""Hagrid applause"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/kQk8TBD9w16Ygjc9FkbSIVRN8c.gif""><p>So firstly, we'll see how to import data to Excel.</p><p>Excel has a limited number of options to assist the data import process. But hopefully, you will find your preferred option among the few.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a well-organized dataset on another Excel sheet, you can simply copy and paste it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if you are just getting started with the data collection process, here's how and where to begin.</p><p>Click on <strong>Data</strong> and choose.</p><img alt=""excel click on data tab"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5GEasK0hi7LPP9FqVf9xHHCEw.png""><p>Here, Excel offers your four options to import data:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>From File: </strong>Import data from your PC</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>From Database: </strong>Import data from SQL servers, Microsoft, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>From Text:</strong> Import data from text or CSV files</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>From Other Sources:</strong> Import data from other sources such as SQL server tables, SQL server analysis cubes, or XML files</p></li></ul><img alt=""excel import data"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/xFPCrRck95NG41B58vTwxKNyJss.gif""><h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Database for Action</h3><p>The dataset you import is called Raw Data.&nbsp;</p><p>That's because the database is filled with extra columns, irregular decimal points, and raw numbers, which you ideally don't want on your dashboard.</p><p>You see, you only want that part of your database which you need to visualize on your dashboard – the heavy numbers, of course.</p><p>For example, we imported a short dataset from our Monthly Sales Report.</p><img alt=""database sample"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Z4WYVvHWJ67GWAnh20ZRBLExo0.png""><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Among the Excel columns from A to E, which one would you prefer not to add to your dashboard?&nbsp;</p><p>To extract meaningful data, create another sub-sheet as <strong>Chart Tab</strong> and copy-paste the dataset from columns into it.&nbsp;</p><p>So now you have the dataset you want to visualize. Now let's start preparing this dataset for action.</p><p>Excel comes with several in-built tools to ease your data cleansing process. Click on <strong>Data</strong>, and you'll have the following options available.</p><img alt=""excel data format options "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/2TslPf7ywyFy67dTcxKnlRbEFM.png""><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Organize data in ascending or descending order</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Data Filtering:</strong> Add an advanced filtering widget to each column</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Custom Sorting:</strong> Sort data by column, value, color, font color, and order</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Remove Duplicates:</strong> Removes any duplicate data</p></li></ul><p>Furthermore, use Excel formulas to simplify the raw database as much as possible.</p><p>Lastly, double-check the dataset for any typos or errors.</p><h3>Step 3: Custom Format Your Charts for Your Preference</h3><p>Once your dataset is cleaned and prepared for data analysis, it's time to add some visualizations.</p><p>For instance, If you want to visualize the Total Product Sold each month, you need an Excel chart, right?.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's how you can make one.</p><p>Select the dataset you want to visualize. Then, go to the <strong>Insert tab</strong> in the top menu bar and choose from Excel's in-built visualization gallery.</p><img alt=""choose a chart type"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/jFzGJZHiCy9MSzQUNgIqVwgiVrg.png""><p>Suppose you opted for a bar graph to present the dataset. Here's how it will be presented.</p><img alt=""total products sold bar chart"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/T6fvDAw5kCRQqvEh0jQ2At1e1I.png""><p>Likewise, if you want to use a different type of visualization to present another dataset, let's say, Return Rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Follow the same steps; select the<strong> Month</strong> and <strong>Return Rate</strong> columns &gt; Click on<strong> Insert</strong> &gt; Choose <strong>Pie Chart</strong> from the visual element gallery. And voila!</p><img alt=""Return rate pie chart"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5Uqy2D3pU4McvP9enhkwyILJ1g.png""><p>Want to use a different type of dynamic chart?</p><p>Excel has tons of them, namely:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Column Chart or Bar Chart:</strong> Visually compare value across a few categories</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Area and Line Chart:</strong> Show trends over time (years, months, or days) or categories</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Pir or Doughnut Chart:</strong> Show the proportion of a whole (generally used for data available in %)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Hierarchy Chart:</strong> Compare parts to a whole or several columns of categories form a hierarchy</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Static Chart:</strong> Show statistical analysis of your data</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Pivot Table: </strong>To summarize selected columns</p></li></ul><img alt=""creating chart for purschases made"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/A6a0VUnAGMjJDyOM3bVIyhSzAYc.gif""><h3>Step 4: Create an Excel Dashboard</h3><p>In the previous step, you learned to visualize data in different forms and figures.</p><p>However, keeping data and its visualization on the same sheet can be daunting later on. ☠</p><p>So to build a full-fledged Excel dashboard, create a sub sheet named <strong>Dashboard</strong>, and move all your data visualization to this sub sheet.&nbsp;</p><p>You and your team can use this sheet as the main dashboard. Doing this will also help you to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Display multiple data visualizations under one sheet</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Control who can access/view/edit the raw data sheet</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Automatically change graph data by making changes in raw data sheet</p></li></ul><img alt=""four excel dashboards"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/AnlNSy1FZttdgw1CGCI7MdCR0.png""><h3>Step 5: Customize Your Dashboard</h3><p>And now to the final step – Customizations.&nbsp;</p><p>To start with customizations,<strong> Double-click</strong> on the chart you want to customize.</p><p>A drop-down menu appears on the right sidebar of your screen with the following options.</p><img alt=""customization options for charts"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/q3beIXHqVapC0ZldQLZ08N1nPfc.png""><p>Use it to customize your chart title, data labels, colors, and data table via chart formatting options.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>You can also use conditional formatting for advanced customization options.</p><p>And that's it! Achievement unlocked! 🏆</p><p>You've created your first interactive Excel dashboard. 🎉&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But as we said earlier, creating an Excel dashboard is a manual process, let’s understand what drawbacks you might face when tracking KPIs (key performance indicators) on Excel.</p><h2>Drawbacks of Creating Dashboard with Excel</h2><img alt=""limitations of using dashboards in excel "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0qhA9XaZ4U44bQGkvtj8Cgwx4k.png""><h3>#1. Very Limited Automation</h3><p>Have you seen an Excel dashboard before? 🤔</p><p>It's so clean and organized, with data on one sub-sheet and visuals on the other. And you probably think doing this is an easy task, just copy and paste, isn't it?</p><p>But very few know that creating this Excel dashboard took hours of manual work, hundreds of left and right clicks, and concentration hard enough to suffer eye pains and migraines. 🧠</p><p>It probably takes hours because Excel provides next to no automation.</p><p>Although at the initial stages of data extraction and cleaning, Excel has some features to remove duplicate data. But again, you're advised to double-check the dataset for errors.</p><h3>#2. No Real-Time Access to Data</h3><p>For those unaware, in Excel, there's nothing like real-time. ⌛&nbsp;</p><p>Unless you're a developer who can connect Excel to a database and code all of the scripts and macros that automatically refresh your data, the data in your Excel spreadsheet will not be in real-time.</p><p>And this is a major drawback if we bridge it to creating dashboards in Excel.</p><p>You see, what's the purpose of a full-fledged dashboard if the data you're viewing is outdated?</p><p>Yet again, you need to suffer through manual processes to update the data repeatedly. And that’s easy, if you work like this 👇🏻</p><img alt=""man typing very fast"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/yJekCEhpYPhuFXRqLLFygA0NKE.gif""><h3>#3. Lacks Customization Options</h3><p>We compared Excel to other dashboard creation tools, and guess what? Excel needs to catch up on providing out-of-the-box customization options to users.</p><p>Yes, it does have customization options. But that's been the same way since 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the type of data visualization elements provided by Excel are rigid and limited.&nbsp;</p><h3>#4. Hard to Onboard Your Whole Team</h3><p>Let's be real, you ain’t running a six-figure business without a team.</p><p>And that makes team collaboration a vital feature of any dashboard. But Excel simply doesn't foster collaboration.</p><p><strong>Think about it:</strong> If you're using Excel as your main data dashboard and are sharing it with your team, it's challenging to manage the version of the Excel spreadsheet that everyone is seeing. This makes it more difficult to collaborate around the data because stakeholders may be looking at different reports.</p><p>Everything results in endless duplication of efforts, lots of unintentional manipulations, and a mess across departments.</p><h3>#5. Bad Mobile Experience</h3><p>This could be a bitter problem for gen z entrepreneurs who manage their businesses using their mobile phones.</p><p>Excel isn't mobile-friendly at all. 📵</p><p>Even if you manage to view your Excel dashboard using the XLCubed mobile app, the flexibility and responsiveness you enjoy in its web application aren't the same elsewhere.</p><p>Next, let’s go through some dashboard examples.</p><h2>5 Free Excel Dashboard Templates&nbsp;</h2><img alt=""Best 5 free excel dashboard templates"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/S8LNVJP9r31NPBLDAA3cJUidc.png""><h3>#1.

A Step-By-Step Tutorial</h2><h3>Steps #1. Define the Purpose of Your Dashboard</h3><p>Before starting the process, let us ask: <em>Why are you creating this dashboard and for whom?</em></p><p>Different stakeholders or departments within the organization would want to analyze different facts and figures.</p><p>For instance, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would prefer looking at key financial metrics, while an investor would want a summarized dashboard of all the departments.</p><p>Keeping this in mind, try to attach a purpose to your dashboard and then collect data around it for accurate and effective decision-making.</p><h3>Step #2: Source In Data and Create a Pivot Table</h3><p>Here’s a raw data set we will be using to create an interactive dashboard in Excel.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BrEFmOhwwxrcjP7A74HDPRGew.png""><p>Let’s first convert this dataset into a table (you can skip this if you already have a table).</p><p>Select your data, go to <strong>Insert</strong> &gt; <strong>Table</strong>. In the pop-up that opens, tick the box - <strong>‘My table has headers,’</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BampEH3U5R99fFvlYg7TsatufA.png""><p>Your table will look something like this:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/R9jHf84gVGuiPXsaNjuES3JyI.png""><p><br>Next, convert the table into Pivot table; this will help you create interactive charts to put in your dashboard in Excel. Select the table, go to <strong>Insert Tab</strong> &gt; <strong>Pivot Table</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> and you will have a new sheet with Pivot Table.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FNwcPzh3oGJgmkMyYBBJl1AeIaQ.png""><p>For our interactive Excel dashboard we want 3 charts, meaning we need 3 pivot tables. To do so, we will just duplicate the pivot table sheet in the Excel workbook.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/aQGdhJx6KGn9hf6shMvpEbnmhw.png""><p>And just like that you have 3 pivot tables ready. Let’s move on to the next step to create charts for our interactive dashboard.</p><h3>Step #3: Create Charts with Pivot Table</h3><p>So our first chart would represent every product’s monthly-wise sale.</p><p>For that we need 3 data entries - Sales, Product, and Month.</p><p>In the Pivot table sheet, drag and drop the Month data in the rows area, product in the columns area, and Sales in the values area.</p><p>Here’s a GIF to explain it to you clearly:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/38u15qFL31w11qD824olWba6i8.gif""><p>If you want, arrange the values in decreasing or increasing order.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lRMLgIRkTnsbWS34yZjN8gBQ.png""><p>Next, click anywhere on the Pivot Table as soon as you do that, you will see a tab - <strong>PivotTable Analyze</strong> appears in the top menu.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/45SS8NhuaSXapnwvAfF2URUyM.png""><p>Next, click on <strong>PivotChart</strong> inside the PivotTable Analyze menu and choose the chart you want to represent your data. In our case, we’re choosing <strong>Stacked columns </strong>from the chart drop-down.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/63Jf6lKxOnlfnhf9JnGrqoGER10.png""><p>The moment you press OK, a pivot chart will appear in front of you.</p><p>Volia! You have made your first chart.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mNdixYG7nRFlxNNVRUzUSwSLg.png""><p>Now, it’s time to style the chart via formatting options in Excel.</p><p>Let’s start by giving the chart a title:</p><p>Click on the <strong>+</strong> sign that you see besides the chart you just created, tick the <strong>‘Chart Title’</strong> box, and give your chart a suitable title.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nwqvb897CRMmmO8qHtGUHfpFI.png""><p>Excel has some basic formatting options that you can use to make your chart look better:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Chart Title: </strong>Change the title of your chart</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Legend: </strong>Enable, disable, and edit legend as needed</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Axes: </strong>Edit horizontal axis and vertical axis of your chart</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Data Table:</strong> Insert a table that represents all values in a data table</p></li></ul><p>Try them out and see how you want your pivot chart.</p><p>After you’re done formatting, you can then move your chart to the Interactive dashboard sheet.</p><p>Repeat the procedure to create such pivot table charts for your interactive dashboard, once you’re done, we’d start formatting and customizing our interactive dashboard.</p><p>When it comes to creating charts, Excel gives you a boatload of options:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Bar charts or column charts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Pie charts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Line charts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Area charts</p></li></ul><p>And many more…</p><p>Here’s how our dashboard looks after creating 3 charts.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Hu3TpEvihSHM9za28vMigqsGY.png""><h3>Step #4. Add Interactive Features to Your Dashboard Design</h3><p>Select any chart you want on your interactive dashboard and click on <strong>PivotChart Analyze</strong>. Go ahead and click on <strong>Insert Timeline</strong>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> For inserting a timeline to any pivot chart, you <strong>MUST</strong> have the Date column in your data.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DCwrKjqMLN4SuplLRPY4Z3MXf2M.png""><p>Tick the Date checkbox and press <strong>OK</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/GB9H2DiCLsbdsLQ9yzU3K7ZOz8.png""><p>This will give you a timeline of the chart.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BoEkB6FgRlOdIxJ2BSjSpjsDTF8.png""><p>In a similar fashion you can add slicer for all the charts you want to on the interactive dashboard.</p><p>Here’s the snapshot of our final interactive dashboard in Excel:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Sc1GJqOPNZsPXs5bPbLY70YsM8.png""><p>Doesn’t it look pretty?</p><p>Now that you’ve seen how to create an interactive dashboard in Excel, it’s time to explore some templates that you can use directly.</p><h2>5 Free Excel Interactive Dashboard Templates</h2><h3>#1.

Limited Scalability</h3><p>Excel struggles with large amounts of data and may become slow and unresponsive. In some cases, you can encounter downtime when multiple users try to access a spreadsheet simultaneously.</p><p>Both ways, Excel is not the first choice for organizations willing to scale their operations from time to time.</p><p>Besides, Excel is a stand-alone application. It does not integrate with other platforms or data sources easily. This makes it challenging for companies with data spread across multiple social and analytical platforms to centralize them under an Excel sheet.</p><h3>#2. Limited Data Visualization Options</h3><p>With Excel, you are limited to using a set of pre-built data visualization elements. </p><p>Yes, the platform does offer customization options, but that too is shrunk to basic editing of charts. 📊</p><p>Suppose we compare Excel's gallery of data visualization elements to Datapad (our tool) or any modern-day dashboard software. The other is more advanced in creating visually appealing and informative dashboards.</p><h3>#3. Lack of Collaboration Features</h3><p>Excel doesn't have built-in collaboration features like Datapad. Meaning you cannot communicate on the go. You have to use a third-party app for real-time communication.</p><p><strong>P.S.</strong> Datapad helps you eliminate this bottleneck. How? We'll talk about this feature in a later section.</p><p>For now, Excel has no control over what version of the application users work upon – 2013, 2016, or 2019. This makes it difficult for users using a different version to experience the exact same dashboard which others are using.</p><p>And when a team uses different versions to access the same dashboard, what they view entirely depends on what their version supports.</p><p><strong>Our POV:</strong> You can’t do anything except circulating a disclaimer to your team asking them to use the same version.</p><h3>#4. Limited Security Options</h3><p>Excel does not have built-in security options, making it easy for unauthorized users to access and modify data. This can often lead to data manipulation and inaccurate results. </p><h3>#5. Limited Automation</h3><p>Being from a 90's background, Excel comes with next-to-no automation. In fact, its users spend most of their time preparing data and double-checking it manually. </p><p>Simply put, Excel does not have the ability to automate the process of data collection and updating. This leads to a lot of manual work, thereby increasing the chances of human errors or unintentional data manipulation.</p><h2>Create Stunning Interactive Dashboards with Datapad</h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hYOE5OK25h0mJfuAPbvFqb3Ins.png""><p>Datapad is the industry's leading mobile-only platform that allows you to create dynamic interactive dashboards and makes data analysis easy for you and your team.</p><p>We've ensured to fit in all the crucial features of creating a dashboard into a powerful mobile app (don't worry, it doesn't consume much space).</p><p>Moreover, we have fully automated the process of creating interactive dashboards, from data extraction to cleansing and presenting; you can do it all in a matter of minutes, provided you have a stable internet connection.</p><p>Moving forward, we'll show how our tool can help you create a stunning dashboard in easy-to-do steps.

Every market sector has a lot of moving parts, and the need for quick decision-making is at an all-time high. It’s a test for hustling entrepreneurs who want their businesses to stand out from the crowd or sustain themselves in a highly competitive marketplace.</p><p>To do so, managers and directors must match the accelerating pace of fierce competition while avoiding employee burnout.</p><p>But how can they cope with it? We believe the answer lies in automation.</p><p>Automating the executive reporting process can do wonders for your organization. It will help you collect, centralize, and visualize crucial business data for upper management.</p><p>Besides, by automating the reporting process, you tend to streamline operations while avoiding human errors when dealing with highly sensitive data.</p><p>This article covers every aspect of executive reporting, the best practices for creating executive reports and dashboards, and a step-by-step guide to how even a beginner can create a mind-boggling executive dashboard in just three simple steps.</p><p>You’re just 5 minutes away from getting another feather in your cap from your senior management in the organization. ⏳</p><h2>What Is Executive Reporting?&nbsp;</h2><p>Executive reporting is a process of providing essential business-related information, such as operational data and KPIs, to top-level executives. It aims to provide a more comprehensive, big-picture overview of the organization's functioning to executives in an easy-to-understand manner (commonly via visuals, diagrams, or charts).</p><img alt=""executives watching reports"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5a7i8RETAzDYVVNksjL1er3CIQ.gif""><p>Besides, executive-level reporting is done for a predetermined period, say monthly, quarterly, or yearly.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Executive reporting is generally not done weekly because, as we said, it's always reserved for the big-picture overview.</p><p>And what constitutes an executive report highly depends on the organizational goals, objectives, and set KPIs. However, three things are always part of executive reports regardless of the size and type of organization.</p><h3>✅ Results</h3><p>While prolific results should be cherished, poor performance should also be accounted for. And hence, executive reporting covers what your company has achieved vs. what it could have achieved.</p><h3>✅ Expenses and Profits</h3><p>Executives' favorite column is the one with $$ into it. After all, being an executive, all they want is to measure the correlation between fruitful numbers and heart-aching expenses. Thus, besides providing insights on results, executive reporting also involves business financial health.</p><h3>✅ Feedbacks</h3><p>Feedbacks are the only thing that gives a human touch to executive reports. It's distinct from all the numbers and graphs on a report. Generally, the feedback includes employees' take on the company's present culture and suggestions for improving performance.</p><h2>What Are the Benefits of Executive Reporting?</h2><img alt=""5 benefits of executive reporting"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/K5ipH2kowPV7JkDhiRTbBFHST1Q.png""><p>Executive reporting covers a broader ground than just measuring results and providing a deeper understanding of an organization's operations. Since it's reserved for top-tier management, it has more to support the cause, such as:</p><h3>#1. Easily Understandable Data</h3><p>Suppose you're an investor planning to pump money into a company. Apart from the general analysis of the company, the last thing you ought to see in an executive report is that it has everything from company finances to operational working.&nbsp;</p><p>But when you receive the report, you see tons of data clusters build-up of numbers, decimals, and percentages. It may take you days or weeks to get a clear idea of the company's operations.</p><p>However, modern-day executive reporting has come a long way. These reports are now well structured and better visualized with charts, tables, graphs, and even infographics to make them easily understood by executives.</p><h3>#2. Can Access on the Go</h3><p>Another thing here is that you can access executive reports on the go. You don't need to stick to your desktop or data analyst to work through the report.</p><p>In the era of digital reporting, many online tools and platforms allow executives to access reports from their mobile phones. So, you can still monitor performances and make informed decisions even if you're not at your desk.</p><h3>#3. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses</h3><p>You need more than just a raw financial dataset and a cluster of stats to get anywhere.</p><p>You should know how different departments add up to the company's success for a deeper understanding of your company.</p><p>Executive reporting not only displays insights but also offers a clear explanation as to why the company is at its bottom line (if it is) in the last quarter. It helps you identify the pain points that can make or break your business in the long-term.&nbsp;</p><p>And that's the most momentous information an executive wants to know about.</p><h3>#4. Empowers Data-driven Decisions</h3><p>The only constant in this volatile and unpredictable market is Data. And since executive reporting is based on the best, most relevant, and currently available data, it does empower you with quick and confident data-driven decisions.</p><h3>#5. Benchmarking Company's Performance</h3><p>Now, the primary benefit of executive reporting – <strong>is to gauge a company's performance against set goals.</strong></p><p>With executive reports, management can easily measure their performance against the set goals and as per the company's strategic plan. Moreover, with set benchmarks and full-fledged reports in hand, executives can tweak or build strategies to drive comforting results.</p><h2>How Can You Create a Better Executive Report?</h2><p>&nbsp;If, after going through your sent report, an executive claims, <em>""Who’s the creator of the report?”</em></p><p>Either it's time to pack your stuff, or you might have really impressed them. A fantastic report can go a long way to helping your executive team better understand the company and lay a positive foot on your credibility with sensitive data.</p><p>As a team, you create executive reports for two purposes:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>To provide information to C-suite executives</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>To impress clients with your data visualization and handling skills</p></li></ul><p>Thus, here are some proven practices you must consider if you want to create a special report that would wow your executives:</p><h3>#1. Stick to Your Audience</h3><p>It's essential that your audience resonates with the report. For example, a report created for the investors should involve data and stats beneficial from an investor's point of view. In contrast, an executive report for managers should have everything that the manager wants to know.</p><p>Simply put, having unrelated information makes a report worthless for the audience. And so, understanding the interests and priorities of your audience will help you include the most relevant information in the most effective way.</p><h3>#2. Pick the Right KPIs</h3><p>Similar to the previous practice, your choice of KPIs highly determines the effectiveness of your report. Again, for example, if you pick marketing KPIs (apt for marketing reports) to create a report for investors and stakeholders, it will lead to nothing else than confusion. Worst case, it might derail your message. 🎯</p><p>So it's important to choose your KPIs in context to your audience – for managers, investors, CMOs, or CFOs, there're tons of KPIs available to cater to the specific needs of the departments.</p><h3>#3. Try Telling Data-Driven Stories</h3><p>Hands down, storytelling is the best way to convey information in an engaging manner. 📜</p><p>Make sure your executive reports are more than just dull pieces of information.</p><p>Instead, by looking at your report, relevant stakeholders should be able to view a dynamic story of your company's strategy and performance.</p><p>Try weaving a story by connecting different datasets with game-changing events, dates, or decisions, like how a particular marketing campaign boosted the company's revenue during a period. Or, use infographics to demonstrate growth and downfall for the decade.</p><h3>#4. Use Data From All Sources</h3><p>Executive reports immensely contribute to a company's decisions. And missing out on data while creating these reports can unintentionally manipulate the overall outcome.</p><p>While measuring data from your most significant data source may be compelling, utilizing the data stack to the fullest will help you connect your data story together.</p><p>Integrating existing platforms such as CRMs, point-of-sale systems, project management tools, and website analytics tools can be a prominent source of data.</p><p>These 4-simple practices can help you create stunning reports. However, you should be aware that executive reports and dashboards are two different chapters of the same book.&nbsp;</p><h3>What Is An Executive Dashboard?</h3><img alt=""executive dashboard gif"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/9MWY8ijCsEUSszeYR61uJ6Vcwhk.gif""><p>Simply put, an executive dashboard is the visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and key metrics that c-suites need to monitor for the smooth functioning of the organization.</p><p>Doesn't this look similar to executive reporting? We got the same vibes, but here's the thing.</p><p>The answer to this question depends on what your specific data needs are. Both reports and dashboards offer key benefits, and their own limitations accompany each.</p><p>Firstly, reports and dashboards both share beneficial scopes. While a dashboard can include several data points and sets, a report can offer a better high-level view of the organization.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a CEO may not need to see specific dashboards for customer support. Still, he would benefit from a report stating how the customer service department performs as a whole.</p><p>On a second note, reports are a product of historical data derived from dashboards.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can create reports from dashboards but not the other way around.</p><p>We consider reports as snapshots of the historical performance of specific organization areas rather than real-time scenarios.</p><p>Dashboards, on the other hand, are built to visualize and organize data in real time. They are dynamic in nature and can be modified to alert users when specific performance metrics change or thresholds are met.</p><p>And lastly, you can do a lot of things with dashboards – manipulate data, customize appearance, integrate with multiple platforms, perform data mashups, advance calculations, and whatnot.</p><p>Reports, however, don't ideally do that. They show a static picture of your live data via visual elements. Probably enough to help executives in effective decision-making.</p><p>Let’s quickly summarize the difference.</p><img alt=""executive dashboard vs executive reporting"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ccg2Vb1Msyuwe16mI7sDM00CDEA.png""><h2>What Should Be In An Executive Dashboard?</h2><p>The foundation stones for executive dashboards are company-level KPIs – the major ones that allow for a quick performance review.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a CEO's dashboard may display KPIs from every department in the organization.</p><p>Here's an example of what to include in a CEO dashboard to monitor a SaaS company's performance.</p><img alt=""list of metrics to be included in Executive Dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/LqiQU1Dd9FjszJLbblj17uxKWKg.png""><p>Besides, there are 1000+ dashboarding tools available on the web (free and paid) that help you create stunning executive dashboards.</p><p>However, before you cherry-pick a tool, ensure that it has these features of an executive dashboard:</p><h3>#1. Real-Time Data Updates</h3><p>To obtain the maximum value, ensure that the dashboard is capable of extracting real-time data from multiple points and existing CRMs.</p><h3>#2. Customizable Interface</h3><p>Customizable interface helps executives find it easy to view or transform data in their preferred manner. In today's world, it makes sense because executives want data to be presented in an accessible, easy-to-read format, thus avoiding unwanted headaches yet ending up making better and confident decisions.</p><h3>#3. Analytical Capabilities</h3><p>To make your big data all refined, polished, and visualized, the software needs to have some advanced capabilities like smart calculators, dast mashups, predictive analytics, etc.</p><h3>#4. Access on the Go</h3><p>Lastly, executives will love to have their dashboards on their mobile phones. We mean, who doesn't like reviewing their own company's performance with a cup of coffee in the mountains? Thus, ensure that the software offers mobile-friendly dashboards.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Do You Create An Executive Dashboard in 3 Steps?&nbsp;</h2><p>To ease your search, we have already reserved the best dashboard tool for you – Datapad.</p><img alt=""datapad homepage"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7Oay0b5ptLfY3YFF1hrlMWdHjQ.png""><p>It's the easiest and free dashboard and reporting tool to create executive dashboards. Besides, our tool just requires you to follow three quick steps, and BOOM! You have your first executive dashboard in action.</p><p>Do you want to see it? Here's how it goes:</p><h3>Step #1. Decide on the Goal of Creating Your Dashboard</h3><p>Why are you creating this dashboard? Is it for a specific department or the organization as a whole?</p><p>As the saying goes, if you are doing something, ensure to tie it with a goal for 10X success.</p><p>The above saying holds true when creating executive dashboards. If you have decided to create a high-level dashboard, make sure you know why you are creating it and for whom. Focus on creating SMART goals:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Specific</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Measurable</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Attainable</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Relevant</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Time-bound</p></li></ul><p>Also, remember to keep your fundamentals clear regarding the choice of KPIs. Your choice of KPIs goes a long way in creating meaningful executive reports and dashboards.</p><h3>Step #2. Choose What You Would Like to Report on the Dashboard</h3><p>Now starts the real deal. To get started with Datapad, download our app (available for Android and iOS) on your mobile devices. Here's a QR code to help you do so:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ahzlAIIAZ2CETrxBI9nNWSqE2WY.png""><p>Once into the app, you are asked to sign up and register with your mail address. It takes us seconds to confirm your email address and then click on the <strong>'Create a dashboard'</strong> button on your screen.</p><p>The app will ask you to add a Title, description, and emoji (😇).&nbsp;</p><p>You can add those and click on '<strong>Create</strong>.'</p><img alt=""create a dashboard "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ROggj4n3h3ySyXQT9ASbdUUv6c.gif""><p>But just a dashboard will do little. You need to pump in some data. Fortunately, Datapad allows you to import Data Manually and Automatically.</p><p>To add KPIs manually, tap on <strong>'Add Metric'</strong> and select Enter Manually. Then, add a value, set comparative standards, and customize the metric as per your company's branding. Later, choose the type of graph you want your KPI to have - A bar graph, Pie chart, Line diagram, or a simple table.</p><p>Look closely at the below GIF to understand the process better.</p><img alt=""add metric to your dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1bfQMWCtcyAK2dDm9VxVlgtQB4Y.gif""><p>Furthermore, you can use our one-click integrations to popular data sources such as Google Analytics, Shopify, Facebook Ads, and more to import data with a click.

Share with Your Executives</h3><p>Onboarding stakeholders, investors, or executives is a hassle-free process in Datapad. You can enter respective email IDs within the app and send email invites with a click.</p><p>Moreover, executives won't feel troubled because who (in the c-suite) doesn't like to have a live dashboard on their mobile phone? Not just to view but to actually monitor the trends and take time-sensitive decisions when required.</p><p>Datapad, however, offers both features. With Datapad's mobile app, you can communicate with your team members in real time within the dashboard. How can you do that? It's simple:</p><p>👇🏻 Comment under the metric which you feel needs attention</p><p>👇🏻 Your team gets real-time push notifications for your comment</p><p>👇🏻 Team members can view and reply to the comment in real time</p><p>What's more, the comment feature works similarly to threads on Twitter (One after another) and can be viewed anytime later for clarification.</p><p>Here’s the feature in action:</p><img alt=""share your metrics with your team "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DcFsXfNYPOLJQaXZtliJcj5uPls.gif""><p>And that’s it!</p><p>With these 3 steps, you could build, customize, and onboard decision-makers and c-suites to view the executive dashboard or just send them executive reporting.</p><p>Lastly, you don’t need to worry about the pricing to build executive dashboards and reports if you use Datapad, it’s a free-to-use mobile app!</p><p>‍</p>"

Besides, this reach covers <a href=""https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/digital-trends"">63.7%</a> of all Americans above 13 years of age.</p><p>So yes, running your marketing campaigns and advertisements on Facebook is a good decision. But how will you track these millions and billions of data coming your way?</p><p>It's pretty simple, track Facebook KPIs.</p><p>Wondering what we mean by Facebook KPIs? Read this article to know all about them!</p><h2>What are Facebook KPIs?&nbsp;</h2><p>Facebook is the world's most active social media platform, with over 2.934 billion monthly active users. Since the user base is significantly higher, the data coming across to you becomes complicated with time.</p><p>We say so because the platform has tons of information to share with you. 😉</p><p>Here, we're not talking about private info but the insights collected from your activities, posts, campaigns, and ads. Here's when Facebook KPIs come into play.</p><p>Facebook KPIs are a set of quantifiable measurements used to gauge the performance of a Facebook page. It measures specific details related to your Facebook pages, like the number of shares, post engagement, follower growth, link clicks, and more.</p><p>But that’s not it.</p><p>There's another category of Facebook KPIs, popularly known as Facebook Ad KPIs, that specifically measure the performance of your ad campaigns on the platform.</p><p>Evidently, a cluster of businesses relies on Facebook ads to build an audience, attract customers, and drive relevant traffic back to the site.</p><p>Facebook ad KPIs help you to dig deeper into your ad campaigns and get insights related to ad relevance, quality, and performance. Unlike Facebook's organic KPIs, they monitor a business's core advertising and marketing analytics.</p><h2>Why Are Facebook KPIs Important?</h2><p>You see, social media has a global outreach of <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/"">4.2 billion users</a>.&nbsp;</p><img alt=""facebook kpi statistics"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/3NthWOjKcrTbM4v8oU5rcG5XQB0.png""><p>More or less, 9 out of 10 people who surf the net use social platforms. This user base is spread across various platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.</p><p>For the most part, Facebook has the most extensive user base. In the U.S itself, it has 182.3 million active users.</p><p>This brings us to the fact that tracking and monitoring Facebook insights are important.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what we think tracking Facebook KPIs can do for your business:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>🧪 Help You Iterate Strategies:</strong> Every ad campaign has an end goal. May it be sales, lead generation, or brand awareness. Your end goal is what determines your KPIs. If your campaigns are not performing as expected, you can briefly look at the KPIs to understand what needs to be worked on.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>📈 Spot Patterns and Trends:</strong> KPIs are not for single-time use. They help you track and compare your performance consistently, believing you have the same goals in place. Hence, Facebook KPIs can immensely help you identify the pattern, trends, and user behavior toward your campaigns or Facebook page.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>👀 Gauge Ad Campaign Performance: </strong>Facebook KPIs are the right set of analytics to gauge your campaign performance. They present you with a detailed overview of campaigns or ad performance.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>✅ Plan Predictive Growth:</strong> When you set SMART Facebook KPIs, you're one step away from accurately predicting growth. These KPIs can let you forecast monthly or annual growth and help you plan ahead to accommodate that growth.</p></li></ul><h2>Facebook KPIs and Facebook Ads KPIs: What is the Difference?</h2><p>Facebook KPIs are classified into two categories: <em>Organic KPIs and Ad KPIs.</em></p><p>When we talk about organic KPIs, we measure posts that don't require an investment, sponsor, or marketing budget. Facebook organic ads are closer to SEO; therefore, the traffic and leads you generate from them are free of cost.&nbsp;</p><p>Some examples of Facebook organic KPIs include the number of post likes, share of voice, organic impressions, and organic reach.</p><p>On the other hand, ad KPIs are used to gauge the performance of a clearly organized and funded campaign on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, you might have a question, Is it necessary to measure your organic and inorganic growth individually?</p><p>The answer is - Yes, at all times. Doing this allows you to examine your marketing efforts distinctively and lays a clear boundary between your paid and organic results.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are the Most Important Facebook Organic KPIs to Track?</h2><h2>KPI #1. Organic Impressions</h2><p>Impressions, in organic terms, measure the number of times your content landed on a user's Facebook feed. Simply put, it's the number of times your content was viewed.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Tracking impressions becomes vital because the ultimate goal of marketing teams is to increase brand visibility. You must ensure that your content is seen by a larger audience.&nbsp;</p><p>The fewer the impressions, the lesser the visibility on the platform, and the fewer chances you have to acquire customers or leads.</p><p>Sticking to the organic side, impressions are a clear indicator of your organic marketing efforts.</p><p>Moreover, measuring this KPI is no rocket science. It doesn't even have a formula. You can sign in to Facebook Creator Studio and click on the content library to access these insights.</p><h2>KPI #2. Organic Reach</h2><p>Reach refers to the number of unique users on Facebook that have viewed your content. Although impressions and reach seem to be alike, they have distinct purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>You see, reach is defined as the number of users that have seen your content at least once, while impressions define the number of times your content was displayed to the audience.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>The higher your organic reach, the higher the chances of generating more leads and acquiring more customers.</p><p>Reach can be categorized into two types:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Post Reach:</strong> The number of unique viewers of your Facebook post</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Page Reach:</strong> The number of unique viewers of your Facebook fan page</p></li></ul><p>Tracking both of these is pretty straightforward. You can easily measure them via Facebook analytics or Datapad.</p><p><strong>Here's the Fun Part: </strong>If the same user views your content twice during a given timeframe, Facebook measures it as one unique visitor.</p><p>So, no matter how often someone re-views your content, it will still be considered as one unique user or counted as one reach.</p><h2>KPI #3. Organic Followers Growth</h2><img alt=""organic follower growth formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/fKXOZNk02XBEJWcxfpCCCIQ1og.png""><p>This KPI measures the change in the number of followers on your Facebook fan page over a given period. It specifically measures follower growth from organic marketing strategies.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Tracking organic follower growth over a weekly or monthly basis tells you how well your content resonates with the target audience.</p><p>A positive follower growth indicates that your marketing efforts are right in place and your Facebook page is progressing and improving with time. Whereas, a negative trajectory is a bad sign.</p><h2>KPI #4. Engagement Rate</h2><img alt=""Engagement rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/cheB5Rh6azIOn7dO5nENtgQKb4.png""><p>This KPI measures the rate at which your audience engages with your content. Facebook engagement is typically measured via three indicators:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Likes 👍</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Share 🔂</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Comment 💬</p></li></ul><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>The engagement rate goes a long way in building your brand reputation. It identifies how many of your followers are actually resonating with your content.</p><p>You see, following a page and liking its content are two different user behaviors. One might follow your FB page but never interact with any of your content.</p><p>From an SEO perspective, a lousy engagement rate decreases page reach. Because if people (even your followers) are not engaging with your content, algorithms have no reasons to show it to a larger audience.</p><h2>KPI #5. Engagement Per Follower</h2><img alt=""Engagement per follower formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/TTy8UjJWZQanTxUM60n8BwTPxOg.png""><p>When you post on Facebook, people tend to engage with it, and calculating it can give you a boatload of insights.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>For a social page, it's important to measure engagement against the number of followers. We mean a fan page with millions of followers, yet 3-figure likes on posts aren't impressive enough.</p><p>Moreover, this KPI specifically tells you what amount of your followers are actually resonating with your content. The higher the number, the more interactive your fan page is to your followers.</p><h2>KPI #6. Video Engagement Rate [VER]</h2><img alt=""VER formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mdepql4r1ry14XMSWaMfy33RTcY.png""><p>This KPI explicitly measures the percentage of impressions that lead to some form of engagement on your video content.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Factually, video content has gained significant popularity in recent times, probably because it generates more engagement than any other content type.</p><p>Usually measured as a percentage, a low engagement rate indicates that the video is not capturing the viewer's attention or that the content is not enough to persuade viewers to engage.</p><p>The best way to visualize this KPI is via a line graph. Or, you can analyze it via Datapad simply and quickly <em>(more on this later)</em>.</p><h2>KPI #7. Share of Voice</h2><img alt=""share of voice formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/u98BkDOcfd70UeJMUsKOmdwQd4.png""><p>Share of voice, or the number of shares, measures the total number of times your content is shared during a given period.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Although 'share' is counted as a measure of engagement, it has more to it. Unlike likes or comments, sharing content amplifies its reach and visibility.</p><p>Moreover, when someone shares your content with their network, people are more likely to engage with it since it comes from a promising source.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides promoting brand awareness, the share of voice highly impacts word-of-mouth marketing and thus is always a popular metric among social media marketers.</p><h2>KPI #8. Referral Traffic</h2><p>This KPI measures the number of visitors who landed on your website after clicking an inbound link from another website.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Referral traffic from Facebook can be of great importance. Tracking this metric can help you gain meaningful insights into potential customers. You can use Google Analytics to track the amount of referral traffic from Facebook.&nbsp;</p><h2>KPI #9. Reach by Post Type</h2><p>This KPI explicitly tells you which post types are performing better on Facebook. That said, Facebook posts are of several types, namely,</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Single post</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Carousel</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Text-based post</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Videos</p></li></ul><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Not every content format is desirable for every social platform. For example, videos on Facebook have a higher engagement rate than image posts. But you can't be sure about it; testing all kinds of posts is the best way to know what works for your account.</p><p>Hence, the reach by post type KPI can help you figure out what truly works for you and your audience. Thereby creating better content strategies to serve the need.</p><h2>KPI #10. Follower Demographics</h2><p>The follower demographic KPI helps you to identify who your followers are, where they are from, and what devices they use to consume your content.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Getting to know your audience can help you define your overall channel strategies.</p><p>By breaking your follower demographics into Country, Gender, or Language, you can customize your content to their specific requirements.</p><p>Moreover, if a specific gender drives maximum engagement to your brand, you can tweak your brand tone for the same.</p><p>Enough about organic key performance indicators, let’s dive into Facebook Ads KPIs.</p><h2>What are the Most Important Facebook Ads KPIs to Track?</h2><h2>KPI #11. Ad Impressions</h2><p>This KPI simply measures the number of times your ad was displayed to the audience.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Ad impressions is a metric that shows how many times your ad was displayed on the user's Facebook feed. This becomes important for marketers who strive for better reach and visibility.</p><p>Low impressions indicate that the Facebook algorithm isn't serving your ads to people. This could be due to a number of factors like low quality-score, targeting the wrong audience, minimal budget, etc.</p><p>Measuring this KPI plays a major role in calculating key metrics such as Click-through-rate, Conversion Rate, cost-per-click, and more.</p><h2>KPI #12. Click-Through-Rate (CTR)</h2><img alt=""ctr formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/vlZFpg94mptfSbieqhdSD0WLg.png""><p>This KPI measures the percentage of users who clicked on an advertisement to the ad's total number of impressions.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>CTR is the most popular metric among advertisers and marketers.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s because Facebook doesn't intend to gain backlash by showing irrelevant content.&nbsp;</p><p>A high click-through rate is vital to your ad campaign success since it directly affects your Quality Score.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re getting a low CTR, your campaign might have:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Unattractive ad design</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Poor ad copy</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Wrong audience targeting</p></li></ul><p>If any of these is true, your ad CTR will be significantly impacted, and so will your quality score. For a Facebook Ad, a CTR of 1.5% is quite good.&nbsp;</p><h2>KPI #13. Cost-Per-Click</h2><img alt=""cpc formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zC8hZrochrv4n3rY3WuIyZgJ9c.png""><p>This metric measures the amount of money you pay whenever someone clicks on your advertisement on Facebook.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>CPC is the money companies pay to advertisers every time a user clicks on their ad. This amount can be whatever you like, depending on the bidding system.</p><p>Tracking this becomes important to measure your ROAS (Return on Advertisements). Although it's great if your ad is getting more clicks, at the same time, it's useless until you can convert those leads into buyers.</p><h2>KPI #14. Cost Per Thousand Impressions [CPM]</h2><img alt=""CPI formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/uEKFzv0vCwfdie6Ppz6WyhzSMdA.png""><p>Cost-per-thousand impressions, or CPM, refers to the amount you pay for your ad to get a thousand impressions.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Although this may not be the best metric for conversion-based campaigns, it's also beneficial when running campaigns for brand awareness.</p><p>This KPI is best used for evaluating ad effectiveness and can provide valuable insights into your advertising strategies.</p><h2>KPI #15. ROAS</h2><img alt=""ROAS formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/A7OulmIubqK1879hnmvcyWTPYpo.png""><p>Return on Ad Spend is a marketing metric that measures the revenue generated from every dollar spent on ads.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>ROAS generally measures the conversion rate of your ads. For example, if you make $10 for every dollar spent on ads, your ROAS is 10:1.</p><p>Simply put, the basic idea behind ROAS is to get back more money than you’re spending on ads.</p><h2>KPI #16. Conversion Rate</h2><img alt=""Conversion rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/H8uN4isNKrXkF3vUzFm7mj0fG6U.png""><p>The conversion rate measures the number of people who took action after seeing your ad. The action can be as complex as enrolling for a free trial to as simple as visiting your website.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Conversion rate is a metric used to gauge the success of an ad. Simply put, it tells you the exact percentage of visitors that convert from your ad.</p><p>A lower conversion rate indicates your ad quality needs to be improved, and you need to run A/B tests to see what's working.</p><h2>KPI #17. Link Clicks</h2><p>When running ads, you ought to have a CTA, and most of your CTAs will be a link either taking your audience to your website to buy something or a link to fill out a form.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>This metric tells you how engaging or compelling your ad is to your audience. Besides, keeping track of this KPI also allows you to track other primary PPC metrics such as CPC, CTR, and more.</p><h2>KPI #18. Video Audience Retention</h2><p>This KPI measures the time duration within which a user is engaged with the video published on the platform.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Even though it’s a complex KPI to track, it can provide you with actionable insights. As a benchmark, a <a href=""https://digiday.com/media/facebooks-watch-off-promising-start-faces-long-road-pursuit-youtube/"">50%</a> video retention rate is considered good.</p><p>Besides, to calculate this metric, you can make use of Facebook insights or <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/dashboard-reporting-tools"">a reporting software</a>.</p><h2>KPI #19. Cost Per Conversion</h2><img alt=""cost per conversion formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oiCSqX4Vffv5vp61gVckYRJ0DxY.png""><p>Cost per conversion, or CPC, refers to the total cost incurred in generating one conversion. It’s calculated by dividing the total money spent on advertising and marketing by the total number of conversions.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Tracking CPC is yet another easy way to figure out how well your ad campaigns are doing.&nbsp;</p><p>A high cost per conversion indicates that something is wrong with your ads. It might be poorly drafted ad copy, or maybe you’re targeting the wrong audience.</p><p>In the same way, a lower CPC could mean your ads are well-optimized for your target audience; hence they convert easily.</p><h2>How to Track Your Facebook KPIs For Free with Datapad?</h2><p>Tracking and monitoring 19+ KPIs can be overwhelming.

Moreover, you can use the knowledge to iterate your strategies and objectives at any point.</p><h2>Why Are Financial KPIs Important?</h2><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>🩺 Monitoring Business health:</strong> Financial KPIs measure your business's overall health and monitor your present revenue and profits, compare past results, and forecast future revenue accumulation. Moreover, they dive deeper into your business's operating cash flow to see if things are running smoothly. Under time-sensitive situations, with the help of financial KPIs, you can foresee any campaigns or strategies hampering your company's health and improvise on them.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>🤔 <strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Progressive decisions are made with adequate capital in hand. Among the various uses of financial KPIs, perhaps one of the most important functions is that they help keep the business objectives the primary focus when making decisions.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>📈 <strong>Projecting Growth:</strong> Undoubtedly, revenue and profits are the best ways to measure a company's growth over time. But there's more; financial KPIs convey critical information under sensitive situations, such as when you're deviating from the plan or signs of a negative trajectory. You can use this information to mold your strategies as per market needs.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>🚧 Creating Budgets: </strong>Annual budget meetings would be havoc if core financial data were missing. Therefore, certain KPI dashboarding tools, like Datapad, allow you to collect, measure, and present financial data via beautiful dashboards to stakeholders.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>💸 Measuring ROI:</strong> What did your business gain from investing money into something? May it be a campaign, advertisement, assets, or employees. Certain KPIs like Return on Equity, Return on Investments, Return per Share allow you to measure the capital gains you receive from multiple investments.</p></li></ul><h2>What is the Difference Between An Operational KPI and a Financial KPI?</h2><img alt=""financial kpis vs operations kpis"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/inUzbRrUEHoJq534SathbekLMn0.png""><p>Finance and operations are part of core business functioning. While financial metrics provide information necessary for the survival of a business. The operations KPIs, on the other hand,&nbsp; oversee the execution of day-to-day tasks.</p><p>Now, while both KPIs are directed toward the well-being of different departments, some organizations tend to correlate the two.</p><p>Let's get this straight.&nbsp;</p><p>Operation KPIs might include financial figures, such as working capital, operating cash flows, and cash conversion cycle.</p><p>But on the other hand, they also include non-financial data such as employees, customers, supply chain, leads, etc.</p><p>While financial KPIs help you determine your operational achievements from a financial perspective, operational KPIs are generally measured for the short term.</p><p>The goals and objectives of these KPIs are clearly poles-apart:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Financial KPIs focus on the profitability, liquidity, and valuation of a business</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Operational KPIs focus on productivity, efficiency, and smooth functioning of operations&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>To summarize our thoughts on operational and financial KPIs, here's a quick overview:</p><img alt=""Differences between financial kpis vs operational kpis"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/U7OsJfyAWhGN8wmAsB9ftg4RigY.png""><h2>What Are the 30 Financial KPIs You Should Track to Stay on Top of Your Financials?</h2><img alt=""Financial kpis to track "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XI2r7Dnn3xyba08HTbyoHAMvs.png""><h2>KPI #1. Gross Profit Margin</h2><img alt=""gross profit margin formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/NEb1lOewBixKG9HQaW6kAlMogU.png""><p>Gross profit margin, commonly referred to as gross margin, is a profitability KPI that measures the amount of revenue left during a given accounting period after deducting labor and material expenses.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>As said, this metric measures the profitability of a business. It calculates the profit earned from each dollar of sales.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the metric is an excellent indicator of a company's financial health. It indicates whether the business is capable of handling its operating expenses while retaining money for growth.</p><h2>KPI #2. Operating Profit Margin or EBIT</h2><img alt=""EBIT formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QwReg6vhqrO1Ol5I7WUL171Ab14.png""><p>Operating profit margin, popularly known as earning before interest or taxes (EBIT), measures the revenue earned by the company after deducting operating expenses, excluding interests and taxes.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Operating profit is also a profitability metric; it calculates the leftover profit after deducting operating expenses. The higher the EBIT, the more profitable your company is likely to be.</p><p>If this trajectory declines over time, you might need to identify the pain points and work on improvements quickly.</p><h2>KPI #3. Net Profit Margin</h2><img alt=""Net profit formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/LJKm6UMoBfxm1zATw3crTSNbis.png""><p>This KPI measures the sum of revenue left with the company after accounting for all its expenses; this includes short-term and long-term debts, operating expenses, and interests and taxes.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Net profit margin is the ultimate profitability metric. You see, it's the money that stays with you after you've cleared out all your debts and liabilities.</p><p>Also, it's a popular metric that helps you compare your business's efficiency to convert sales into profits. As a rule of thumb, a net profit margin above 10% is considered acceptable.</p><h2>KPI #4. Levered Cash Flow [LCF]</h2><img alt=""LCF formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/H0TpzDTGDj3neNyrBCA2GhE9Q.png""><p>Where,</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>EBIT refers to earnings before interest and taxes</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>NWC means a change in net working capital&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>CapEx refers to capital expenditure</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>D equals mandatory debt payments</p></li></ul><p>Levered cash flow is the amount of money left after all the company's financial obligations are met.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>LCF defines a company's ability to expand its operations and pay returns to stakeholders. A higher levered cash flow means a higher dividend for shareholders and maximum capital retention for business expansion.</p><p>However, even if the levered free cash flow is negative (for a while), it doesn't necessarily mean the company is failing.</p><p>As long as the company holds the necessary cash to survive, a negative LCF is both survivable and acceptable.</p><h2>KPI #5. Working Capital</h2><img alt=""working capital formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/D34K1l4Ahu7MQ1AOQoZA0TZNY0.png""><p>Working capital measures the surplus of current assets available to meet short-term financial obligations, specifically day-to-day company operations. The current assets can be available cash, investments, accounts receivable, and more.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Working capital is a liquidity metric, i.e. it measures the ability of a business to generate cash quickly. This cash is not based on assumptions; it's hard-core cash ready to be put to work.</p><p>A cash-deficit company may find it hard to survive in the market. Hence, a high working capital demonstrates a healthy business.</p><p>However, a surprisingly higher working capital may indicate that your assets are not being utilized to the fullest or the firm is not investing surplus money.</p><h2>KPI #6. Current Ratio</h2><img alt=""current ratio formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/3PqXSJlv1A7gOoBgGHPL41HiFU.png""><p>The current ratio measures an organization's ability to pay its short-term liabilities within a year. Unlike working capital, this KPI expresses itself in ratios instead of dollars.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>A Current Ratio of less than one indicates that your company will not be able to fulfill all financial obligations for the year unless there's an additional cash flow.</p><p>Financial experts say a healthy current ratio is between 1.5 and 3. Moreover, stakeholders generally use the current ratio to evaluate a company's operating cash flow.</p><h2>KPI #7. Quick Ratio or Acid Test</h2><img alt=""quick ratio formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/OEgmjy8IMz1PtWeZhmyhOQ4el9Y.png""><p>Another ratio defining the liquidity of a company is the quick ratio.</p><p>This KPI measures the amount of current assets that can be quickly converted into cash to meet short-term financial obligations. Unlike the current ratio, which considers payments for the year, the quick ratio focuses on immediate cash.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Quick assets are the ones that can be quickly converted into cash. In other words, quick assets are current assets like inventory.&nbsp;</p><p>The metric also demonstrates the company's ability to generate quick cash if experiencing cash flow problems.</p><h2>KPI #8. Gross Burn Rate</h2><img alt=""gross burn rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oDq87xGO74CCScvOUJkZFzYTklQ.png""><p>The gross burn rate reflects the rate at which a company uses its available cash to cover its operating expenses.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>This is a common KPI among loss-generating startups. You see, as a startup founder, the foremost thing you measure is the amount of cash available to carry out daily business operations. It's a fundamental metric for small firms that do not undertake heft financial analysis.</p><p>A higher burn rate indicates a shortage of funds to cover daily expenses unless additional finance is brought into the business. Being said that, investors often consider a company's gross burn rate to decide whether to provide funding or not.</p><h2>KPI #9. Break Even Point</h2><img alt=""break even point formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wveedTmko6H6afDZfWVjowEUN0Q.png""><p>The Break-even point represents that stage of a business where the total revenue generated equals the total cost incurred.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>The Break-even point is a situation of no profit or loss. Here, all your costs have been recovered in full. Whatever you earn after this point is considered as profits.</p><p>Businesses generally measure it by how many units of products they need to produce and sell to break even.</p><h2>KPI #10. Accounts Payable Turnover</h2><img alt=""account payable turnover formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lw3eY5fISUu8KgXdjauFzn92OU.png""><p>Accounts payable measures the pace at which you pay your suppliers. It basically measures a company's ability to clear out short-term debts.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>This KPI is best for measuring financial stability. It measures the efficiency of financial teams and the business's reputation with its suppliers.&nbsp;</p><p>An increase in the AP ratio indicates you have surplus cash in hand and are paying your suppliers faster and faster.&nbsp;</p><p>Down the lane, this will help increase your rapport with vendors, and you may be privileged to discounts based on quick payments.</p><h2>KPI #11. Accounts Payable Processing Cost</h2><img alt=""Accounts payable processing costs formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5TfYU48SEwjlQSk4Ljn8jH8OXko.png""><p>Accounts payable processing cost, popularly known as cost per invoice, measures the processing cost incurred on paying bills to suppliers.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Business finance is not just about overall revenue and profits. It's an establishment built on several bricks of minimal transactions. Thus, cost-cutting is significant whenever and wherever possible.</p><p>Generally, processing costs include bank charges, mailing costs, labor, and overheads. Since cash out-flow is something a business can’t ignore, this KPI is preferably measured on a weekly or monthly basis.</p><p>As of today, several businesses have switched to email invoices or e-billing to decrease invoice processing charges.</p><h2>KPI #12. Accounts Receivable Turnover</h2><img alt=""Accounts receivable turnover formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eNmDjnIOxF6Xhqj81c7LGCd1So.png""><p>Accounts receivable turnover measures how efficiently a business collects payments from customers.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>A book filled with credits is nothing more than interest-free loans, which you could otherwise use to expand your business. Besides, a positive AR ratio strengthens a company's operating expenses.</p><h2>KPI #13. Days Payable Outstanding [DPO]</h2><img alt=""DPO formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNbxsXFlUWpdOrXbQXTE6HmePVI.png""><p>Days payable outstanding is a financial ratio that measures the number of days it takes for a company to pay out its suppliers.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>DPO is a somewhat granular metric as it tells you exactly the time (in days) it takes for you to pay your debts. Indirectly, these insights provide a glimpse into your company's financial health.</p><p>A high DPO can be a good or bad indicator for you; it can mean:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Your business is retaining capital for long enough to make investments and expand business</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Your business doesn't have the required capital and thus requires additional finance to pay off the debts</p></li></ul><h2>KPI #14. Days Sales Outstanding [DSO]</h2><img alt=""DSO formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/b4TX8pdCUvOkpmt99LOT78Nm1g.png""><p>Days sales outstanding (DSO) measures the average number of days it takes to collect payments for a sale.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Now, this metric is essential if you're lending products on credits or on an EMIs or subscription basis, requiring monthly evaluation.</p><p>Besides, given the operating expenses of a company, it's in their best interest to speed up the collection process to maintain healthy operational cash flow.</p><h2>KPI #15. Inventory Turnover Ratio</h2><img alt=""Inventory turnover formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lOVFVVrFlar4bUtDKbtpmfpybWA.png""><p>The inventory turnover ratio measures the number of times your company clears out all its inventory during a given period.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Insights driven by this KPI can help you make better pricing, production, marketing, and purchasing decisions. Generally, the higher the ratio, the better.</p><p>A lower ratio might indicate weak sales strategies or inventory pile-up. It can also mean you’re not purchasing the product that's in demand; hence, you're unable to sell it.</p><h2>KPI #16. Days of Inventory Outstanding [DIO]</h2><img alt=""DIO formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DroAmQZP7w0o6qwTIUn5LSrlrvs.png""><p>While inventory turnover calculates the number of times inventory was turned over, DIO measures the number of days it takes to turnover inventory, typically in a fiscal year.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>This metric explicitly measures the average time it takes to sell off your inventory. As a result of this, allowing you to schedule new orders before D-day. Moreover, since you know a time frame, you can get prepared with order lists and purchase cash beforehand.</p><p>For e-commerce industries, this metric can help with better inventory management and also prevent them from receiving orders for out-of-stock items.&nbsp;</p><h2>KPI #17. Cash Conversion Cycle [CCC]</h2><img alt=""CCC formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/bBVLx3Amzd921SAcNLElKVZjY4.png""><p>The cash conversion cycle measures the time a company takes to convert its inventory investment back into cash.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>It's a crucial metric to evaluate the efficiency of your operational and managerial departments. The longer it takes for a company to convert its inventory into cash, the longer the money is tied up in the inventory, and neither can it be used nor counted as revenue.</p><h2>KPI #18. Budget Variance</h2><img alt=""budget variance formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XnzXn0fZwDjVfkjkLzoqqb1AyzI.png""><p>Budget variance, as the name indicates, compares the project budgets to the actual budget total to identify any surplus or deficit in allocated budgets.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Budgets are set for a purpose, and that is to complete a particular task under the forecasted expense and resources.</p><p>In case, intentionally or unintentionally, there is a variation from the forecasted budget, it must be accounted for.&nbsp;</p><p>This metric evaluates whether the budgeted or baseline amount of expenses or revenue meets the expectations. A lower budget variance indicates that the actual expenses are lower or equal to the allocated budget. In contrast, a higher budget variance goes the other way around.</p><h2>KPI #19. Budget Creation Cycle Time</h2><img alt=""budget creation cycle time formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/E9NXyoPVgbQqv8sLaWcnAGBI.png""><p>This pretty straightforward metric measures the time taken to create a company's budget.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>The time taken to create a budget is idle for stakeholders or financial teams. It indicates the time taken to research, plan, and agree on a final budget. The longer the time frame, the more resources you're exhausting in terms of staffing, business hours, and brainstorming meetings.</p><h2>KPI #20. Return on Equity [ROE]</h2><img alt=""ROE formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/vxikMD9cGV6qGMBWUHIVYaoNrG8.png""><p>Return on equity is a profitability ratio that measures a company's net income to its shareholder's equity.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>This metric determines a company's efficiency in utilizing its shareholder's equity. A low ROE indicates that the company is not effectively using the shareholders' investments.</p><p>It also demonstrates that a shareholder can get a better ROE investing elsewhere. Therefore, a company always aims for a higher ROE to retain maximum shareholders.</p><h2>KPI #21. Return on Investment [ROI]</h2><img alt=""ROI formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zuiaHtiSQKoPEUcngnmLRrePcM.png""><p>This KPI measures the amount of money an investment generates to the cost of investment.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>As a business owner, every investment you make must yield results. This is because you're making an investment as a company, and every investment is answerable to stakeholders and should thrive on revenue gains or business expansion.</p><h2>KPI #22. Payroll Headcount Ratio</h2><img alt=""Payroll headcount ratio formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/S92gqSBnzf9LI8QrAUoaszWExO8.png""><p>The KPI is specific to the HR department of the organization. It measures the total no. of full-time employees involved in payroll processing to the number of employees.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Typically, organizations track this KPI to measure the efficiency and productivity of the HR department. In a scenario where the number of employees per HR specialist becomes more, the company can lay out strategies and resources to delegate workload.</p><h2>KPI #23. Sales Growth Rate</h2><img alt=""sales growth rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wcAsW8r2hcaT68UUcAAwV6VkMWU.png""><p>Sales growth rate refers to the net change in total sales during a given period of time. It's a typical revenue metric that can gauge your sales growth over time.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Sales are a vital part of the company finance ecosystem; thus, they always aim toward growth. However, a company's sales might take a hit due to internal or external factors. Therefore, sales team managers are keen on measuring and comparing sales time after time.</p><h2>KPI #24. Fixed Assets Turnover [FAT]</h2><img alt=""FAT formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/iN7Z5nc64NSnncKc5fK1IGHJY64.png""><p>Fixed assets turnover is an efficiency metric representing how well a company uses its mixed assets to generate sales.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>This KPI is essential to companies that invest in PPE (property, plants, and equipment). A higher FAT indicates that the company is efficiently utilizing its fixed assets to generate more sales, while a lower FAT goes the other way around.</p><h2>KPI #25. Return on Assets [ROA]</h2><img alt=""ROA formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lFSSAqBBO6wb9hX3dV88JRzjI.png""><p>Return on assets is a broader concept than fixed assets turnover. The KPI measures the efficiency of a company's management to generate profits from its assets (current and fixed).</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Suppose you purchase two cars each for your top executives. Although it's an asset to the company, the return on this investment doesn't feel great. That’s because a car is a depreciating asset.</p><p>Likewise, the profit you can generate from revenue collected from accounts receivables, days of sales payables, and equipment utilization – everything accounts for the overall return on assets.</p><h2>KPI #26. Interest Coverage Ratio</h2><img alt=""Interest coverage ratio formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/O6BxvOWjpVCCChxT5OaxKl1yQCE.png""><p>The interest coverage ratio measures the ability of a company to pay off the interest on its debts.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>The <strong>‘coverage’</strong> here stands for the time frame. Investors and lenders typically use this ratio to determine the company's uncertainty on current debts or future borrowings.</p><p>A lower ICR represents the company's inability to pay interest on loans and debts. For the most part, the company's capital strength becomes questionable if the ICR drops below 1.5.</p><h2>KPI #27. Earning Per Share</h2><img alt=""EPS formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Dju3key1lblUKeHWIo7AuvXRk.png""><p>Earning per share refers to the amount of money a company makes from each share of its stock.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>You might have heard of EPS quite often; after all, it's the most quoted financial metric. Lenders, investors, and creditors often use EPS as a measurement of a company's profitability and also as a way to estimate its market valuation.</p><h2>KPI #28. Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h2><img alt=""Debt to Equity ratio formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/LFIaR4A7oqhgXSUtUI4CqIk.png""><p>Like Return on Equity, this KPI measures how effectively a company uses investments to increase revenue and drive profits.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>The debt-to-equity ratio typically measures the company's liabilities against the shareholder's equity. A ratio greater than one indicates that the company is losing investments and accumulating debt, which might worsen during downtime.</p><h2>KPI #29. Average Annual Growth Rate [AAGR]</h2><img alt=""AAGR formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BRCWot4eKilKwdJZutsxYtiOI.png""><p>​Where,</p><p>n is the number of years over which the growth occurred</p><p>The average annual growth rate, or AAGR, calculates the average annual return of an asset, investment, or any growth that is measurable.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Generally, investments and assets pay acceptable returns over many years. So, certain KPIs such as ROI, ROE, and more are not the best metrics to track long-term returns. AAGR is the best replacement as it calculates annual growth.</p><h2>KPI #30. Number of Budget Interactions</h2><p>Lastly, a pretty simple KPI, but one that can tell you a lot about your management. Number of budget interactions measures the number of times a set budget is iterated or changed due to external or internal factors.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Frequent interactions in budgets can promote unhealthy culture in the organization. Even employees might feel distracted due to often budgetary changes for marketing, remunerations, or salary hikes.</p><h2>How to Track Your Financial KPIs For Free with Datapad?</h2><img alt=""Datapad KPI tracking tool "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oTY2XwZtMRPLbdOWoYePZmslE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a mobile-friendly KPI dashboarding tool that allows data-driven leaders and finance enthusiasts to collect, analyze, and present overall financial performance via easy-to-understand dashboards.</p><p>Unlike typical desktop dashboarding platforms, our tool gets everything done on your mobile.

If you plan to track <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/what-is-a-kpi"">KPIs</a> with Geckoboard, do you know how much it would cost?</p><p>You will have to go with Geckoboard’s Scale plan for 30 dashboards, and that’s $699/month.</p><p>Why pay so much when you have several Geckoboard competitors to try out in the market?</p><h3>Reason #2: Poor Customization Features</h3><p>When it comes to KPI tracking, customization is a prominent feature to look for.&nbsp;</p><img alt=""G2 negative geckoboard review - 2"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PPTCOFadHtkDvnr437CKuFcBUY8.png""><p>To build a highly personalized<a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-dashboard-software""> KPI dashboard</a>, you must use a tool that lets you create a dashboard from scratch and customize it the way you want.</p><p>Let’s imagine you are the CEO of an email marketing agency and have multiple clients.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a no-brainer that every client will demand tracking of different KPIs that they think might make or break their email campaigns. If you tell them you can’t do that, you will probably lose the client.</p><p>So why wait for this to happen if you can just switch to a better Geckoboard alternative right away.</p><h3>Reason #3: Lacks Premium Features that Other Software Have</h3><p>Geckoboard lacks some premium features like Shopify filters and has relatively less data from Instagram.</p><p>Shopify is the biggest source for merchants to launch their eCommerce stores.</p><p>It’s the most used platform in the US and holds a market share of 31%.</p><img alt=""pie chart for ecommerce technologies being used"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/iBD2JN0aULzS3XxXVWzdhzqro8.png""><p><a href=""https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/country/United-States"">Source</a></p><p>KPI tracking is one of the primary objectives of any eCommerce store, no matter the niche they’re in; that’s how they track, scale, and become profitable.</p><p>Unfortunately, Geckoboard just has a handful of Shopify filters - not enough to dig deep into the data.</p><p>One other feature that needs attention is data pulling from Instagram. The platform has this feature but lacks depth.</p><p>People love shopping on Instagram. <a href=""https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/"">According to Hootsuite</a>, 44% of active Instagram users use it to shop weekly; that’s huge!</p><p>Apart from the three major drawbacks above, there are some others as well.&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You can only display data points that Geckoboard sets</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The dashboard might lose connection anytime, which can lead to data loss</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google sheets or any other spreadsheets might lose their formatting during integration</p></li></ul><p>When it comes to functionality, Geckoboard is limited and offers basic KPI tracking dashboards. It lacks complex features and isn’t pocket-friendly.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, we’ve tested some free as well as paid KPI dashboards and curated a list of top software that can serve as a great Geckoboard alternative.</p><p>Let’s start with the free ones.</p><div><br></div><h2>4 Best Free Geckoboard Alternatives&nbsp;</h2><h2>#1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hYOE5OK25h0mJfuAPbvFqb3Ins.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> helps you track all essential <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">metrics </a>from stunning dashboards.</p><p>The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease-of-use.

People seek alternatives to GoodData for several reasons:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Lacks of customization options</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Confusing UI design</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Expensive and inflexible</p></li></ul><p>Let's dig deeper into these reasons.</p><h3>Reason 1. Confusing User Interface</h3><p>Mastering GoodData for data analysis and visualization can be challenging. The app interface is not smooth, and understanding its workings requires extensive training.&nbsp;</p><p>Navigating within the platform is also time-consuming and cumbersome. For example, there is no folder management for insights. Finding a previously created insight is nearly impossible, and it's easier to start over (which makes the clutter worse).</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Zi3aIH308GJc4ni5dqk1q651Q3U.png""><h3>Reason 2. Difficulty in Handling Large Datasets</h3><p>Valentin, a business analyst for a medium-sized business, encountered system slowness when dealing with large datasets.</p><p>GoodData’s Data Loading Mechanism (DLM) is not user-friendly, making it quite hectic compared to the more intuitive LDM building in Tableau or PowerBI.</p><p>Besides, some basic features are missing, such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Creating custom charts is very convoluted.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Sorting needs to be globally consistent. For example, you can't sort a pivot table by its total sum.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You can't hide fields in the data model.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You can't use OR filters - everything has to be either an AND filter or made via custom expressions.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You can't calculate min/max dates. For example, the MIN date of a sale or something similar.</p></li></ul><p>The lack of nitty-gritty functions, coupled with the system's inability to handle large-scale data analysis, leads users to seek alternatives to GoodData.&nbsp;</p><p><em>""…when used with large data sets, the system slows down when generating reports. Sometimes they have limited our ability to quickly churn out and analyze reports as needed.""</em> - <a href=""https://www.g2.com/products/gooddata/reviews/gooddata-review-10126181"">Valentin P</a>., Business analyst.</p><h3>Reason 3. GoodData is Expensive</h3><p>GoodData does not offer a free plan. For other plans, it charges a hefty $1500 platform fee plus $30 per user per month.</p><p>Imagine scaling your data processes with GoodData. The pricing feels over budget and inflexible for startups and SMBs, too.&nbsp;</p><p><em>""...as our data needs grew, the limitations became apparent. Scaling the platform for larger datasets got expensive quickly, and the pricing structure felt inflexible for our evolving requirements"". </em>- <a href=""https://www.g2.com/products/gooddata/reviews/gooddata-review-9310912"">Jessica W.</a>, Senior Marketing Executive</p><h2>9 Best GoodData Alternatives</h2><p>Some of the best alternatives to GoodData are:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Datapad</strong>: Track all your essential business metrics with stunning dashboards.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Tableau</strong>: Leading data visualization and business intelligence platform.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Looker</strong> <strong>Studio</strong>: Cloud-based data visualization tool from Google.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Domo</strong>: AI-powered analytics and business intelligence platform that supports a low-code/no-code environment.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Zoho</strong> <strong>Analytics</strong>: Powerful self-service business intelligence (BI) and data analytics platform.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Luzmo</strong>: API-first platform that helps you analyze data with AI.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Power</strong> <strong>BI</strong>: Robust BI and dashboarding tool developed by Microsoft.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Redash</strong>: Open-source data management platform.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Explo</strong>: Features powerful tools to enhance data visualization and exploration.</p></li></ul><h3>1.

Report Creation Takes Too Long&nbsp;</h3><p>Although you get several pre-built report templates, they're all not perfect for copy-pasting purposes. You often need to spend a lot of time customizing the report as per your requirements.</p><p>For the most part, data collection and visualization get more challenging as you scale up with Google Data Studio. You start encountering frequent delays in updating sources and lags in refreshing and stacking data.</p><img alt=""G2 review google data studio"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Vtnyl9Hrmh3e3jKE7btPigp4l5A.png""><p>Even though you have already spent enough time figuring out the perfect bars and graphs to represent your data, these additional delays might waste your time.</p><h3>Reason #2. Lack of Real-Time Updates</h3><p>Real-time updation of data is also an issue with Google Data Studio. We came across several complaints from data researchers about how long it takes to obtain data that is 100% accurate.</p><img alt=""G2 review google data studio"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/EGoxbq6C3Zt7FOsIfGGqf7DMfVY.png""><p>Although the platform is backed by plugins to combat the issue, when it comes to creating up-to-date reports, the user interface is something you would still dislike.</p><p>Similarly, Google Data Studio lags when using real-time data and report connections as queries get more complicated and lengthy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Reason #3. Limited Customization Options</h3><p>Google Data Studio isn't a suitable solution for large agencies and organizations with large clientele and several KPIs to track. You may ask why.</p><img alt=""G2 review google data studio"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pZ53SXnXcjc4uyLJntP9KDfhr9E.png""><p>Data Studio limits you with the number of charting options you can use for data visualizations. You must know that with Google Data Studio, you're limited to as low as 50 components and data points per page.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the platform provides an interactive user experience, advanced users may find the customization features lacking compared to other business intelligence and data visualization tools.</p><h3>Reason #4. Lack of APIs and Integrations</h3><p>Lastly, among the weaknesses mentioned above, the lack of APIs for automation and the limited data sources is something that you will crave when using Google Data Studio.</p><p>In today's hyper-competitive business environment, automation is a sought-after feature for any tool, irrespective of its functions and purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, top-performing agencies often need ad-hoc data delivered daily or at least weekly, in addition to monthly or quarterly reports.</p><p>While that's possible using manual processes in Google Data Studio, the absence of any way to reliably employ agency automation (without employing workarounds) can quickly throw a wrench in your reporting workflows.&nbsp;</p><p>When talking about integrations, there's no doubt that Google Data Studio provides seamless integrations within Google's ecosystem. However, the same becomes complicated when you want to source data from a third-party application.</p><img alt=""G2 review google data studio"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mwanBnHHjGHuBkCxUhB4iHgP6JE.png""><p>The lack of native integrations to popular data sources like HubSpot or Salesforce might turn out to be a problem for users.</p><h2>What are the Best Alternatives to Google Data Studio?</h2><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Datapad: </strong>Best all-in-one mobile-first alternative for Google Data Studio</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Looker: </strong>Well-integrated into Google’s ecosystem</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Databox: </strong>Do complex data visualizations with ease</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>InetSoft: </strong>Comes with unique data mashup technology</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Grow: </strong>No-code BI and data visualization</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Infogram: </strong>Beautiful dashboards and visualization elements</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Agency Analytics: </strong>Build for agencies to send across white-labeled reports</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>DashThis: </strong>Automated marketing reporting software</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Geckoboard: </strong>Easy to share dashboards on TV screens and with teammates</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Qlik Sense: </strong>Extensible and customizable APIs</p></li></ul><img alt=""google data studio alternatives comparison table"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Z1CPPtQVgPNwsRKO3qfPx9djlEc.png""><p>It’s now time to review the above-mentioned alternatives in detail.&nbsp;</p><div><br></div><h2>#1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> helps you track all essential <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">metrics </a>from stunning dashboards.</p><p>The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use.

However, Google Data Studio comes with a steep learning curve for novice users. Datapad, on the other hand, is an easy-to-use tool with a fantastic user interface.</p><p>When it comes to automation and customization flexibility, again, Google Data Studio lacks behind in many ways. Here're a few other reasons why Datapad can be a better alternative to Google Data Studio.</p><h3>3 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Use Google Data Studio</h3><h4>#1. If You Want to Do a Deep Data Analysis and Not Have a Quick Overview of Your Data</h4><p>With Google Data Studio, you can't drill down data as much as you can with Datapad or any other KPI dashboarding tool.</p><p>Although it’s a free tool, you need some depth to analyze KPIs and make data-driven decisions.</p><p>It’s crucial because your company’s growth depends on results that come out of KPI tracking.</p><h4>#2. You Don't Want to Have a Mobile-Only Experience&nbsp;</h4><p>Mobile phones, being your closest family member, helps you in every possible way. And you expect your dashboarding tools to be mobile-friendly, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, Google Data Studio canvas doesn't have a responsive design. This means your dashboard won't fit your mobile screens.</p><p>And even if it does (miracles happen, you know), you are bound to stare at this because editing an unresponsive dashboard would be a headache.&nbsp;</p><h4>#3. You Need Several Integrations</h4><p>Google Data Studio isn't a great choice if you're a large organization with a lot of data to monitor for different layers and departments.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the platform is well-integrated into Google's ecosystem, sourcing data from an external source is time-consuming.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, the tool lacks integrations to some popular platforms like HubSpot and Salesforce.&nbsp;</p><div><br></div><h2>#2.

But there's a catch; it's not primarily a <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-dashboard-software"">KPI dashboard software</a> - which means it doesn’t have dashboard-specific features to track KPIs.</p><p>You have to do a lot of things manually (which you will see later in this article) and give a lot of time to create a single dashboard, let alone multiple.</p><p>But if you're a small business that doesn't have the funds to spend a dime on KPI tracking software, you might as well use Google Sheets.</p><p>Let’s walk you through the process of dashboard creation on Google Sheets.</p><h2>How to Create a Dashboard in Google Sheets?</h2><h3>Step 1: Database Creation</h3><p>To track any KPI, the first thing you need is a database. When it comes to Google Sheet, you have two data sources to extract data from:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Google Forms: </strong>You might've asked your customers to fill a Google Form; if so, you'd have a ready-made Google Sheet with all the data. This comes in handy when you might want to <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-track-kpis"">track KPIs </a>like net promoter score or a demographic-related KPI.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Export CSV: </strong>Maybe you have all your data on a CRM like HubSpot; you can just export the data as a CSV file and open it in Google Sheets.</p></li></ul><p>Whatever method you use, automating database creation isn’t the strong suit of Google Sheet - there are limited options.</p><p>For this article, we will take <strong>'Monthly lead conversion'</strong> as an example database.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The list of values you see in the image below are just for example consideration.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/c7HHs92Oknz5hrKWQnGTtBWyCOM.png""><p>The data you see above is quite simple and straightforward, but if you're dealing with complex data, maybe from Google Analytics and have thousands of rows, you can use the following Google Sheets features to sort and quickly analyze it.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Conditional Formatting: </strong>Set colors, conditions, and much more to sort your data&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Data Validation: </strong>Limits the type of input you can enter&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Filters: </strong>Lets you sort data in increasing and decreasing order</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Vlookup:</strong> Find and sort data vertically</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Hlookup: </strong>Find and sort data horizontally</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Pivot Table: </strong>Helps sort and isolate data efficiently</p></li></ul><p>So you have your database ready, now is the time to get to the main part.</p><h3>Step 2: Generate a Chart</h3><p>Creating charts in Google Sheets is easy. Just select the range of values (or range of cells) you want to make the chart of. Go to <strong>Insert</strong> and click on <strong>Chart</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/KyN0RJPB0PM2dzsdXrMZ04TcimM.gif""><p>With GSheets, you can customize your chart via chart editor. You can:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Select Chart Type: Column charts, pie charts, bar charts, and much more</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Personalize graphs by adding titles</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customize charts by adding background color, changing fonts, and more</p></li></ul><h3>Step 3: Convert the Chart into a Dashboard</h3><p>It's time to bring raw data to life - we mean converting the graph you just created into a custom dashboard.</p><p>There are two ways you can convert your chart into a dashboard on Google Sheets.</p><h4>#1. Publish It</h4><p>When you go for this method, Google Sheets generates a sharable link and publishes your chart on the web. You can share this link with your team members. This also allows you to manage permission of who can edit and view the dashboard.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/aSB5mfE5MfxIfOVRFCZ8btJ6N0.gif""><p>But there's a major drawback with the publishing method. When you edit your raw data, the dashboard will take forever to reflect those changes.&nbsp;</p><p>To solve this problem, the best way to make a Google Sheets dashboard is by using another method. Let's tell you what that is.</p><h4>#2. Move to Own Sheet Option</h4><p>Although you will have to keep toggling between tabs time and again, this method reflects changes in real-time.</p><p>You can simply click the three dots you see on the top right-hand corner of the chat and select the 'Move to own sheet' option. What this will do is create a new tab in the same sheet and move your charge there.&nbsp;</p><p>You can then see how quickly it reflects changes when you change values in raw data.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/llD1j6mZXJICRw1o65aShKjEI.gif""><p>Congratulations, you have created a dashboard successfully.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait, there’s more!</p><h3>#Bonus: Creating Multiple Dashboards</h3><p>For any business, tracking 1 KPI isn't enough. So to track multiple KPIs on Google Sheets, you need to repeat the procedure above and keep creating charts and making a dashboard, as shown in step 3.</p><p>We know this is labor work, but there's no way around it. After spending 30-40 mins, here’s a dashboard we created.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the final version of what our dashboard on Google Sheets looks like.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/qvWICmdumcPQwdHq6KNXIfMQ5g.png""><p>‍</p><h2>Drawbacks of Creating a Dashboard in Google Sheets</h2><h3>#1 Next to No-Automation</h3><p>You might think that being one of Google’s hardcore services, Google Sheets must have some sought-after features. But here’s the biggest drawback.</p><p>Google Sheets provides next to no automation. For example, if you plan to automate your data extraction and management process, Google Sheets won't help you with any automation to support the cause.</p><p>It requires you to manually input and edit every piece of data to your Google Sheet dashboard. However, you can create custom automation by writing a script (some code) or using add-ons such as Zapier to keep your data live.</p><p>But again, too much extra work just to import data to your dashboard.</p><h3>#2 Hard to Onboard Your Whole Team</h3><p>Are you creating this dashboard just for your convenience? Or, do you want your team to collaborate with you on crucial metrics and KPIs?</p><p>You might wish to add people from different departments to gather constructive feedback or share performance with stakeholders. But here’s the thing.</p><p>While Google Sheets is an excellent collaborative tool that allows your team to add data quickly, it slows down once many collaborators are on board. Unfortunate but true!</p><p>Google Sheets has a comparably poor interface for managing team activities. It puts you in a blind spot when it comes to project management.</p><p>Even some of the day-to-day functions like task management, time tracking, communication, and cataloging of the internal database cannot be achieved with Google Sheets dashboards.</p><p>Thus, while creating dashboards with Google Sheets, you must maintain complete documentation of your team activities.</p><h3>#3 Poor Mobile-Interface</h3><p>Unlike other pocket-friendly dashboarding software in the market, Google Sheets is far from the competition.</p><p>Google Sheets dashboards are poorly optimized for mobile devices. That means the features available on its mobile version are comparably lesser than what its desktop version offers.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/CvrEd9khT0LOYpH6zdrynMTQKE.png""><p>On another note, since Google Sheets lacks automation, managing tons of data under your fingertips gets you prone to errors.&nbsp;</p><h3>#4 No Scaling Option</h3><p>As an organization grows, so does its database. Hence, it’s expected for any data management software to scale as your business grows.</p><p>However, the number of rows and columns in Google Sheets is limited to 10 Million cells.&nbsp;</p><p>The number might sound friendly for small teams, but for large organizations that collect millions of data daily, the scarcity of cells might cause a halt in their overall process.</p><p>Thus, it can be difficult for large organizations to continue using Google Sheets for data visualization and analysis.</p><h3>#5. Few Integration Options</h3><p>Another drawback of Google Sheets is its integrations with third-party platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Google Sheets works best within Google’s workspace - Google Docs, Google Drive, etc.</p><p>However, if you are already set up with other applications, you might notice it takes extra time and effort to transfer or export data to Google Sheets.</p><p>Till now, you might have understood how hard it is to <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-build-dashboard"">build a dashboard</a> on Google Sheets. Lucky for you, we have an easy, quick, and hassle-free solution for it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Creating Dashboard Easily with Datapad</h2><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a pocket-friendly KPI tracking dashboard and analytics tool that helps entrepreneurs track, analyze, and manage critical business KPIs.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eyY2EqHqnnwehgO83zVOJie4M2A.png""><p>Datapad is designed to make data analysis easier, especially for those using Google Sheets.

It's All Manual</h3><p>Google Sheets comes with next to no automation. That's bizarre because, being Google's prominent services, you expect it to be flawless.</p><p>But the sad truth is Google Sheets ain't a fully automated tool. For example, if you plan to automate your data input and tracking process, Google Sheets won't help you with any automation.</p><p>You need to manually input and edit every piece of data to your Google Sheet dashboard.</p><p>The most you can do is to create custom automation by playing with the script. However, that will require a certain level of coding skills. Your call!&nbsp;</p><h3>Reason #2. Limited Functions and Formulas</h3><p>We came across multiple customer reviews where they weren't impressed by the functions and formulas provided by Google Sheets dashboards.</p><img alt=""google sheets review"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7mbFSxfBBlyJpMAAvbfpdVeQvWo.png""><p>Coming to functionalities and formulas, we came across another customer who found it overly complex to work upon.</p><img alt=""google sheets user feedback "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/tJGpDMRnSYZYsPR5bK6NK9cQlA.png""><p>Google Sheets definitely have limited functions and formulas. Even certain add-ons cost you a dime sometimes.</p><h3>Reason #3. Few Integration Options</h3><p>Google Sheets isn't very friendly with its third-party integrations.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you want optimum utilization of Google Sheets, it works best within Google's workspace - other integrations might pose problems.</p><p>However, if you are already set up with other applications, you might notice it takes extra time and syncs third-party tools with Google Sheets.</p><p>Till now, you might have understood how hard it is to <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-build-dashboard"">build a dashboard</a> on Google Sheets.

All it needs to be is clean, interactive, and user-friendly, supporting the objectives of forward-thinking businesses. However, there are certain principles or steps to consider if you want to design a stunning dashboard.</p><p>Let's get through these steps one by one.</p><div><br></div><h2>#1. Decide on the Goal of Creating Dashboards</h2><p>Before actually building your dashboard, you must steer clear of the three questions below:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>For whom are you doing this?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How are you going to approach it?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What are you expecting out of it?</p></li></ul><p>First and foremost, if you’re planning to share a dashboard with your team, your team should be kept in mind.</p><p>Eventually, they are the ones who will use your dashboard to drill down data. And, they are the ones for whom you're building it.</p><p>Try to make your dashboard user-friendly. Put yourself in your team members’ shoes and visualize the context and device they might use to access your dashboard. Let your dashboard serve a purpose to your team. It can be as simple as providing clear information from messy data.</p><p>Next, you need to figure out why you’re doing this and what outcomes you expect?&nbsp;</p><p>To get started, you need to consider those <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">KPIs and metrics</a> that will add value to your goals.</p><p>Revolve your dashboard around questions like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What exactly needs to be measured?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Who will measure it?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What is the time interval to be measured?</p></li></ul><p>Frequently answering such questions allows you to make purpose-driven decisions. Plus, once you clearly understand your goal, it becomes easier to collect, analyze and measure data (more on this later).</p><div><br></div><h2>#2. Identify Your Data Sources</h2><p>When it comes to building new dashboards, data collection can be an overwhelming and time-consuming process. However, it's an integral part of creating a good dashboard.</p><p>For starters, there are two kinds of data sources:<em> Internal </em>and <em>External</em>.</p><p>Internal data sources are those when data is collected from within the organization, for example, from company databases, sql reports, and files.</p><p>Whereas, external data sources are those when data is collected outside the organization. For example, collecting customer data from a third-party platform or tool.</p><p>You must be clear on the source of data you are accumulating and that the data being sourced is accurate and reliable. For the most part, data is the backbone of any great KPI dashboard and has the power to make or break your business.</p><p>Therefore, you should identify your probable data points before rushing your data collection process. Later, these data points will be frequently used to update your data regularly.</p><p>We advise you to prepare a list of data sources, no matter if its social platforms or Excel spreadsheets and keep track of all the sources you use to pull data into your dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, it helps when a KPI dashboard tool provides some kind of automation to do this. And Datapad does just that.</p><p>Datapad is a KPI visualization tool that gives you the choice of importing data automatically (via one-click integrations) as well as manually.</p><p>Let’s first see how you can import data to Datapad automatically.</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Sign in to your account and click on the <strong>‘+’</strong> button at the bottom of your screen.</p><img alt=""datapad dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Dsrvgzfx9oTASW9006EiJUuy4g4.png""><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Press the button <strong>‘Use a Data Source.’</strong></p><img alt=""datapad create a new metric"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/rYG9Bj4rH4yAfqbGyt8e1HmeiH4.png""><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Choose the data source from the several options Datapad gives you. Our platform integrates with the likes of Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, Tableau (owned by Salesforce) and many more.</p><img alt=""list of integrations"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/YzExJ6Gw74PavA1MiVuLldJWSg.png""><p><strong>Note:</strong> We’re coming up with new integrations regularly.</p><p>Here’s how you can import data manually.</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>After clicking the <strong>‘+’</strong> sign, instead of tapping on Use a Data Source button, just press <strong>‘Enter Manually.’</strong></p><img alt=""create metric manually"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/2VwyyOWkF8SLtgM5qkpnVy8VPCc.png""><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter the title, value, and set goals for your desired KPIs, and that’s it.</p><img alt=""custom metric value customization"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hYxh0eIi9zvY73xBznGsUTymoGI.png""><div><br></div><h2>#3. Choose the Right Chart Type</h2><p>Modern-day dashboarding software comes along with ease to merge and visualize data the way you want. However, it's still important to choose the right data visualizations and chart types to display your real-time data in an accessible and understandable manner.</p><p>Dashboard-centric charts interrelate your data and visualization efforts. They are classified into four primary categories: relationship, distribution, composition, and comparison.</p><p>To choose the right chart type for your analytics dashboard, you should first look into the KPIs and metrics you will track and measure from your dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>When you’ve finalized the KPIs, you can choose a chart from the list below to represent it:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Line Charts:</strong> Great for displaying patterns of change over a period of time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Bar Charts:</strong> Excellent for comparing multiple items and easily recognizable patterns</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Pie Charts:</strong> Ideal for rapid scanning, not very effective in displaying all data (users mainly notice the bigger slice)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Sparklines:</strong> Compact charts useful for displaying large metrics and trends; no individual values are displayed</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Scatterplots:</strong> Great for advanced visualizations; aims to find the correlation between two variables</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Gauge Charts:</strong> Easy-to-understand charts with a colorful representation of different values of the same metric</p></li></ul><p><strong>You should know: </strong>There's another chart type known as bubble charts which experts find unfit for a dashboard (but you might’ve seen them on a dashboard).&nbsp;</p><img alt=""bubble chart"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/3sp4hLorwf4UnauyCp2LPGVY.png""><p>We’d suggest you stay away from them; the reason being, they lack preciseness and clarity and require too much focus even to consume simple information.</p><p>The chart types mentioned above show that different charts are available depending on how and what you want to communicate through your KPIs on the dashboard.</p><p>For the most part, stick and aim for the four categories mentioned above to choose the right chart type and present your data set in the most engaging form.</p><p>Let’s now see how you can add a chart from Datapad to a dashboard.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the<strong> ‘+’</strong> button you see at the bottom of your mobile devices.</p><img alt=""datapad add a new metric"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Dsrvgzfx9oTASW9006EiJUuy4g4.png""><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press<strong> ‘Enter Manually’ </strong>to add a KPI to Datapad.</p><img alt=""datapad enter KPIs manually "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/2VwyyOWkF8SLtgM5qkpnVy8VPCc.png""><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> On the top of your screen you will see four icons, those are the type of charts you can use with Datapad. Press on the first icon to get a bar graph.</p><img alt=""kpi customization"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/52kExBYXWIdxfbqlJhxXBAYcKg.png""><p>The second type is a pie chart.

Define What Metrics You Want to Track</h2><p>Once you have decided your ultimate goal, identified data sources, and opted for the right chart type. It's time to consider the key performance indicators (KPIs).</p><p>By term, KPIs define your business performance and help you shape the direction of your dashboard. These indicators summarize your data and present them as actionable insights on your dashboard.</p><p>Eventually, KPIs gauge your performance against your goals. Being said that, let's get an idea of what KPIs align with your business goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a list of five important metrics businesses should keep an eye on.</p><h3>#1. Customer KPIs</h3><p>Customer KPIs define your business relationship with your customers and vice versa. For example, customer retention KPI, customer satisfaction KPI, total email subscribers, CAC (customer acquisition cost), and more.</p><h3>#2. Operational KPIs</h3><p>Operational KPIs are used to measure employee satisfaction. Since frequent layoffs or poor productivity can hinder your business operations. Examples of operational KPIs include employee turnover rate, employee retention rate, and more.</p><h3>#3. Financial KPIs</h3><p>As the name suggests, financial KPIs are inclined toward measuring your business's profitability or financial health. For example, net profit margins, gross profit margins, accounts receivables, and inventory turnover rate. These metrics help you improve business intelligence.</p><h3>#4. Marketing KPIs</h3><p>A set of KPIs tracks your marketing campaigns and generates actionable insights to improve your current business strategy. These metrics include monthly website traffic, qualified leads, and call-to-action conversion rates. #5. Sales KPIs</p><p>Sales KPIs help you analyze your sales funnel efficiently. It gives you insights into your lead-to-sales conversion rates. Some sales KPIs include revenue growth, sales by month, cost per lead, annual sales comparison, etc.</p><p>A set of purpose-driven KPIs allows you to analyze what's working for you and what's not. It gives you a data-driven approach to your performance and aligns your daily operations with your long-term goals.</p><div><br></div><h2>#5. Pick Your Colors When Building Dashboards</h2><p>Besides being insightful, your dashboard should have the right blend of colors to make it easy to understand and attractive to eyes.</p><p>Unlike the boring PowerPoint presentations from the 90s, the modern dashboard is minimalistic and clean.</p><p>You don't need to be an expert in crafting a stunning <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/dashboard-design"">dashboard design.</a> All you need to pick is the right combination of colors that precisely display each aspect of your dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you can choose a color combo that fits your business identity or a completely different color palette (till it doesn’t hurt your eye).&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever is your go-to option, make sure you stay consistent with limited (2-3) color combinations throughout your design.</p><p>Moreover, here're some common color mistakes to avoid</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Excessive use of highly saturated colors (bright orange, bright yellow, etc.)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Using high-tone color pixels</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Using poles-apart colors to display similar metrics</p></li></ul><p>Although these mistakes seem simple, they can greatly impact your dashboard readability and user interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an example of a Marketing dashboard we have at Datapad.</p><img alt=""marketing mobile dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nuc7x3A5OZ0EPl9oVh4jaehqsQ.png""><p>Do you notice how clean and soothing to the eyes it is?&nbsp;</p><div><br></div><h2>#6. Ensure that Your Dashboards are Mobile-Optimized</h2><p>With <a href=""https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview"">5.32 billion</a> mobile phone users globally, another great practice for designing awesome dashboards is optimizing them for mobile devices.</p><p>By allowing remote access to your most critical metrics, you can flexibly manage your business from anywhere around the world.</p><p>But bare in mind, your <a href=""http://www.datapad.io/blog/mobile-dashboards"">mobile dashboard</a> layout isn't the same as your desktop version.</p><p>Since mobile phones are compact and have smaller screens, your dashboard will need to fit in the space; therefore, the KPI positioning will differ from what it's on your desktop.</p><p>To do so, make sure to use mobile-friendly dashboard templates. Plus, while designing for mobiles, remember to showcase the most important metrics first and pull back other casual details to enhance user focus on key metrics.</p><p>Moreover, take into consideration the <em>Big Finger Element</em> and <em>Thumb-scrolling </em>principle.</p><p>The big finger element suggests that not all users have small fingers to click on comparably small buttons. To make your dashboard user-friendly, enlarge the clickable elements in your dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, thumb-scrolling refers to the habit of individuals using their mobiles just with their thumb. However, this limits their access to certain mobile screen areas, but they are positive about it.</p><p>So, when your users love using their mobile via thumb. You should ensure your dashboard elements are not distanced far from their reach. This allows a better user-friendly experience and enhances the ease of working on your dashboard via mobile phones.</p><p>But with Datapad, you don’t need to worry about any of this. Because our mobile app helps optimize dashboard for mobile by default.</p><img alt=""mobile analytics dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hviUW520QH5s4147PWZZqzfgro.png""><p>Our app lets you:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-track-kpis"">Track KPIs </a>from anywhere in the world</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get easy access to your metrics in time-sensitive situations</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Communicate with your team around the KPIs via live comment section</p></li></ul><div><br></div><h2>#7. Onboard Your Team Members</h2><p>Another significant feature of a good dashboard design is team onboarding.</p><p>Even though your data is well-presented in a dashboard, it still requires a dedicated team to measure, analyze, and determine outcomes from lengthy databases.</p><p>That's why you should be able to onboard and share dashboards with your team easily. It must allow you and your team members to view, rearrange, and edit data in real time.</p><p>For example, if you need to present a marketing dashboard, it would make sense to ask the team, executives, or relevant stakeholders to provide you with constructive feedback on the dashboard, whether it's focused on campaign performance, marketing budgets, or lead generation strategies.</p><p>This way, you can be sure to respect the best practices for dashboard design and deliver outstanding visuals.</p><p>One other thing that might help you create dashboards easily is if a platform has permission management features.</p><p>A KPI tracking app like Datapad can help you bring your team onboard easily and quickly.</p><p>What’s more, you can assign unique KPIs to individual team members, assign them a dashboard, and let them work their magic.</p><p>The team collaboration features of Datapad lets you:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get notification wherever the KPI’s out of bounds</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Communicate with you teammate via comment section</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get push notifications on your phone to stay updated with all your KPIs</p></li></ul><div><br></div><h2>#8. Communicate with Your Team Around Your KPIs</h2><p>Suppose you want to provide feedback or share suggestions about a specific metric. You wouldn't want to write down the matter, message your team lead on Slack, and keep visiting the dashboard to check if the updates were made.</p><p>Instead, how good would it be if you could communicate and collaborate while staying within your dashboard. That's a sign of a good dashboard - ease of communication.</p><p>A good dashboard allows your team to communicate around your KPIs in real time.</p><p>For example, <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a modern-day dashboarding solution that allows you to comment below KPIs and let other teammates see your messages in real-time. This enables seamless communication and a collaborative work culture around teammates.</p><img alt=""Datapad commenting under kpis"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/t9rBqDFKCH7y22akPXPyjYt9s8U.png""><div><br></div><h2>Datapad: Keep all Your Dashboards in Your Pocket</h2><p>Datapad is a pocket-friendly dashboarding tool that allows business users to collect, measure, analyze, and visualize crucial KPIs from your mobile phones.</p><p>The platform offers a highly responsive mobile dashboarding experience enabling you to manage your business performance from anywhere in the world.</p><p>Besides assisting with team communications, Datapad has a clean, minimalist design, with KPIs and elements built keeping in mind the big finger users and the thumb scrollers.</p><p>Moreover, Datapad's highly customizable dashboards allow you to change color and make interactive dashboards in minutes.</p><p>Right now, our app is in its beta testing stage.

Below we have curated a detailed list of all the available chart styles and types and also laid emphasis on how to use chart in Google sheets in the best possible way.</p><h3>#1. Line Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/K5njqO7LNYxyZXC8Fo5Ycum7Q.png""><p><a href=""http://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-make-a-line-chart-in-google-sheets"">Line charts in google sheets</a> are typically used to show changes in trends over time. These chart types are created by plotting several points on the chart and then connecting dots via singular lines.</p><h4>Best Use Case of Line Chart</h4><p>Ideal for showing trends in sales or profit margin over a month, quarter, or year. For example, annual home loans, monthly subscription revenue, etc.</p><h3>#2. Combo Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pDtle83hSkyjCUZagJlrFnH3nU.png""><p>As the name suggests, a combo or combination chart is a mix of line charts and bar graphs used to visualize contrast datasets.This allows users to display different types of data in a single chart, such as a line chart and a column chart, to compare different sets of data more effectively.</p><h4>Best Use Case of Combo Charts</h4><p>Combo charts are best to use when you want to highlight each data series with a different marker within the same chart.</p><p>For example, a combination chart is an excellent choice if you want to showcase the monthly revenue and % increase in profit margins on the same graph.</p><h3>#3. Area Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hYyDMHOFXoi4X6PP2nTQA2935s.png""><p>Like line charts, area charts help you compare one or more data series graphically. They allow you to determine the change in trends over different data categories.</p><p>The difference is that the area chart uses shades below the line to showcase the magnitude of trends.</p><h4>Best Use Case of Area Chart</h4><p>It's best used to showcase data that depict a time-series relationship, for example:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Compare revenue and expenses over time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Compare the volume of imports and exports every month</p></li></ul><h3>#4. Column Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/9wi88TG0Ac47T9uQF7axcFE1U.png""><p>A column chart helps you display different categories or groups of data using rectangular or vertical bar charts. Moreover, it helps you easily compare values of different data series over time.</p><p>Google Sheets provide two types of column charts</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Stacked column chart:</strong> To showcase a part-to-whole relationship</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>100% Stacked column chart:</strong> To show relationships and trends when the cumulative total isn't important</p></li></ul><h4>Best Use of Column Charts</h4><p>Marketers and data analysts widely use column charts to perform comparative analyses. Ideally, a column chart is a good fit for tracking, measuring, and comparing 10-12 datasets at once.</p><h3>#5. Bar Graph</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/CACJjo7f26UBRNmzbft2f6mKmM.png""><p>A bar graph is a graphical representation of data using vertical or horizontal bars or strips to compare the difference between two or more data points or groups.</p><h4>Best Use Case of Bar Graph</h4><p>Bar graphs are typically used to compare individual items. Some of its use cases include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Compare ticket sales by location</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Breakdown of employees by job titles</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Compare % of website traffic from different sources</p></li></ul><h3>#6. Pie Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/dc3remQKn9VtntsVrqnlZV7v68.png""><p>Pie chart is a type of chart in which a full-drawn circle is divided into several slices or portions, each representing a part-to-the-whole.</p><h4>Best Use of Pie Chart</h4><p>A pie chart can only be used if the cumulative total of individual slices adds to a meaningful total. Some of its use cases include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Showing percentages of types of customers</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Percentage of revenue from different products</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Region-wise sales of a particular product</p></li></ul><h3>#7. Scatter Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/CjMllz5WCwmC13IzNM0s8Elo48.png""><p>A scatter chart shows numeric coordinates along the horizontal (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis) axes and helps viewers easily understand the relationship between two variables.</p><h4>Best Use of Scatter Chart</h4><p>Scatter charts are best to use when you want to find out how one variable is affecting another. For example:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Salary of employees vs. years of experience</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Ice cream sales vs. temperature</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Revenue vs. expenses</p></li></ul><h2>How to Create a Chart in Google Sheets?</h2><p>To those who always ask us, “<em>how do I create a chart in Google sheets</em>?”</p><p>Peeps, we’ve finally come up with the easiest step-by-step guide on how to make a data chart in Google Sheets. </p><p>So without further delay; Let’s dive in 😄</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DeD5gi2K7Gt3m2iadS7mkswhSc.png""><p>For this article, we've created a simple dataset to help you quickly understand how to chart data in Google Sheets.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Q1K6YqoOx2qjxKTl9EF5dE6Px8.png""><p>Here, column A depicts the time series, while column B represents the values corresponding to specific time periods, and C represents the profit each year.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To create a chart, you must have at least two primary columns. The first one has a timeframe, and the second column has the values you want to visualize.You can also have three or more columns for combination chart types.</p><h3>Step #2. Create a Chart From Your Dataset</h3><p>Now that we have a dataset, let's learn how to add a chart in Google Sheets.</p><p>For initials, select the dataset (columns) you want to present via chart.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RKJ4bziAdOshVdmxA26jaxELyE.png""><p>To insert chart in Sheets, click on<strong> Insert</strong> in the menu bar. </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/MI8rkk7BRBpcGs9GOFZk85XjlE.png""><p>A drop-down appears with a list of elements. Click on <strong>Chart</strong> and that’s it.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/rPq5iNhD2lYseVs6BB9kzjyBFPU.png""><p>Google Spreadsheets automatically presents you with a default chart type to visualize your data as it did for our dataset with a line chart 👇🏻 </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/CgihSOIhttqBiq4FVH2eFxMKVUU.png""><p>So, this was how to add a chart in Google sheets. Moving forward, we'll learn how you can change the default chart type and visualize your dataset as you desire.</p><h3>Step #3. Change the Default Chart Type</h3><p>We feel this is the best part of creating charts on Sheets. You can instantly change the chart type as per your preference.</p><p>To do so, <strong>Click</strong> on the chart and then click on the <strong>Three vertical dots</strong> in the top right corner.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/dEPAofKmMTDKS4Cv6R5Y6j3NEW8.png""><p>Then click on <strong>Edit Chart</strong> to open Gsheet's in-built Chart Editor on the right sidebar.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You can also double-click on the chart to open the editor directly.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/d9sw2anaMoGax3X33nYjl8qkDA.png""><p>In the chart editor, click on the <strong>Chart Type</strong> drop-down to access a gallery of pre-built templates and charts from Sheets.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ajL26thOAu4DvtIjyOp9Amlt4g.png""><p>Here, the first section comprises chart suggestions from Gsheets. You can choose a chart type from there or a completely different one from the gallery. Your call! 🤙🏻</p><p>When you have made a choice, simply click on the chart icon, and your existing chart will be replaced with your chosen one in real time.</p><p>As an example, we tried representing our dataset using a column graph. So, we scrolled down the gallery and clicked on the <strong>Column Chart</strong> icon 👇🏻</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/2fumfS4BAmSlaCuTmCNunU4Bk.png""><p>So this is how to add chart in Google sheets. In the next step, we’ll discuss how you can edit or customize a chart in the app.</p><h3>Step #4. Custom Format Chart As Per Your Preference</h3><p>To customize your bar graph, click on the <strong>Customize</strong> menu in the chart editor.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5p3Yk5gb1DiJ1IXbWGNoXVwJ2M.svg""><p>Here’s what you can do with the customization option:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Change data range</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Change axis labels, axis titles, and sub-headers</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Include / exclude gridlines</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Interchange horizontal axis and vertical axis</p></li></ul><p>And that's it!</p><p>You now know how to make chart on Google Sheets. However, when you perform the practice in real life, you may encounter certain drawbacks of using Gsheets.</p><h2>Drawbacks of Creating Charts with Sheets</h2><h3>#1. Not a Mobile Friendly Platform</h3><p>As part of the superior services provided by Google, we expect Google sheets to stand tall on all grounds. 🏆</p><p>However, when it comes to using Gsheets on your mobile devices, you can find it uncomfortable.</p><p>You see, creating charts on Gsheets desktop version vs. mobile version can trigger completely different experiences for users.</p><p>Although the platform has a dedicated mobile app, users may still find it challenging to create charts on the go. You may ask why?</p><p>The Google Sheets mobile app isn't well-optimized to function perfectly on small screen devices.</p><p>In fact, within seconds into the app, and you’ll likely encounter one of these:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Difficult to scroll through the sheet</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Half-volley graphs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Complications in managing and visualizing data</p></li></ul><h3>#2. Might Get Slow When Processing Huge Datasets</h3><p>Another noticeable drawback of Gsheets is its inability to process heft databases.</p><p>Although Gsheets offer <a href=""https://blog.golayer.io/google-sheets/google-sheets-limitations"">10,000,000 cells</a> to collect and organize data, it won't take you that long to figure out that your application has already slowed down. 🐌</p><p>And this becomes problematic for large companies that generally deal with terabytes of user data.</p><p>When such companies use Gsheets, they are constantly under threat of data security and integrity.</p><h3>#3. Limited Number of Customizations</h3><p>Google Sheets offer a countable number of customization options. Unlike the modern-day chart creation tools, Sheets allows you to perform basic customization to your charts.</p><p>On the other hand, Datapad (our tool) provides tons of pre-built charts, tables, graphs, and widgets for hassle-free data visualization <em>(more on this later)</em>.</p><h3>#4. Limited Data Import Options</h3><p>Sheets offer next to no integration options. This means you can import data in just two ways:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>By importing another spreadsheet that has data</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>By manually entering the data labels and values</p></li></ul><p>While modern-day dashboard and chart creation tools like Datapad allow you to import data from various data sources and platforms with a click.</p><p>You might be wondering what’s the buzz around Datapad. 🐝</p><p>Well!

Input Data</h3><p>Open a blank Google spreadsheet and make three columns, namely:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Task Heading:</strong> Includes each task name</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Start Date:</strong> When did the task begin?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>End Date: </strong>When did the task end?</p></li></ul><p>As a sample dataset, we have created a table with ten tasks and their start and end date.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hCIiSudxlcng2WV7GlCANTkb5Y.png""><p>Now to create a Gantt chart, you need to calculate time durations for every task.</p><p>Had a hard time with Maths? 🤔</p><p>No worries, we've got the formulas ready for you.</p><h3>Step #2. Calculate Task Duration</h3><p>Create a second table with three columns:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>A: </strong>Task Heading</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>B: </strong>Start Date</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>C:</strong> Time duration</p></li></ul><p>The first two columns are similar to the above table. So simply copy-paste the values of both columns in the second table. </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7eQVOKXz6RtAPvrskea3LZpDiY.png""><p>Next, you need to figure out the start day for each task so that the bars accurately display the start date and task duration.</p><p>To do so, use the Google spreadsheet formula: <strong>=int(B2)-int($B$2)</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This formula translates into 👉🏻 Current Task's Start Date – The First Task's Start Date</p><p>In our formula, B2 represents the first value in the original 'start date' column. You can change this variable if your table positioning is different.</p><p>Insert the formula in the second table's first cell of the start date column (B15 in our case). And then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7uspt4yoAz3xjyLezSOQWnw9U.png""><p>Let's be real; the first/earliest task will obviously start on day 0. And so did our formula. </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ggmp8RTV3JHHc9G90f47xwTg.png""><p>Now click and drag the blue box in the same column until you reach the last task heading.</p><p>The sheet converts the timestamp to an integer for the number of days in the date range. Like it did for our dataset.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Zz16M1cBPK6l4QTnBqwTTH9S2Ns.png""><p>Now, to calculate each task's duration, copy-paste the below formula into the first cell of the Task Duration column (C15).</p><p><strong>= (INT(C2)-INT($B$2))-(INT(B2)-INT($B$2))</strong></p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/poEhC63cR02hf4KDlwsp5LplY0.png""><p>In the task duration column, Sheets calculate the number of days to completion of each task.</p><p>Like in our dataset, the first task requires two days to finish. Similarly, copy and paste the formula down to the last task in the same column.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/2RrkBVrbxdleCR97tl21Jl25U.png""><p>Again, if you have a different table alignment, the cell numbers in the formula will change accordingly.</p><h3>Step #3. Create a Stacked Bar Graph</h3><p>Highlight all the cells in the second table, then click <strong>Insert</strong> &gt;<strong> Chart</strong></p><p>Google sheets automatically present you with a stacked bar graph. Side by side, it also opens up the Chart Editor on the right sidebar.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/t4CNhQtAOdXTDPKwHLisLZNdi4.png""><p>Now let's see how to insert a Gantt chart in Google sheets.</p><h3>Step #4. Change Bar Chart Appearance Into a Gantt Chart</h3><p>Click on the <strong>Start Date</strong> bar on the chart. In our example, it's represented by the color blue.</p><p>As we click on it, the series section opens up in the customizer on the right sidebar.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PP8vrDSjDQr7yFbWCKNB6LCEosk.png""><p>Next, click the <strong>Fill Opacity</strong> drop-down menu and go for <strong>0% opacity</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7zl9Pyv4JrvqqHlUqS1E9zW82mA.png""><p>How to add a Gantt chart in Google sheets? Guess what! You already did it. 😉</p><p>You see, when you change the opacity of the Start Date bar to 0%, your stacked bar chart resembles a classic Gantt Chart.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/VVpGkRdweSus4wuMNLoJi20xf4.png""><p>Now the question remains, how to edit Gantt chart in Google sheets?</p><p>So for that, you can use the customizer, which offers various elements to customize every section of your Gantt chart.</p><h3>Step #5. Customize Your Gantt Chart</h3><p>We'll start with basic customizing options first.</p><h4>#1. Chart Style</h4><p>Click on <strong>Customizer</strong> &gt; <strong>Chart Style</strong>. Or you can simply double click on the chart to edit it.</p><p>You can change the background color, font style, and chart border color from here.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ELYQbmV73nun1fbfoSNubRf6nE.png""><p>Furthermore, you can also tick on one of these boxes – <strong>Maximize</strong>, <strong>3D</strong>, <strong>Compare mode</strong> – to change the view of your Gantt chart.</p><p>For example, we thought of presenting our chart in 3D, and here's how it looks.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/IYDANwa4HUqZqcE8r7RqeEohFs.png""><p>Next, for those unaware, we'll show how to change title of Gantt chart on Google sheets.</p><h4>#2. Chart &amp; Axis titles</h4><p>Click on <strong>the Chart &amp; axis titles </strong>element below the chart style. From this section, you can change the chart title text, font style, size, and colors.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/rGTG20w47XF8RKCoMY6kjRBKfo.png""><h4>#3. Legend</h4><p>What's a legend?🤔</p><p>Nah, we’re not talking about Dwayne Johnson.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/keGbvzkciVbFSoHPeejnr7fAWA.gif""><p>A legend in charts resembles the various types of data in the Gantt chart.</p><p>In our dataset, we have two legends.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/50C4mImYN6VD2GsO6jS7apUneE.png""><p>Ideally, a Gantt chart doesn't require a legend since we have to visualize a single dataset, i.e., Task Duration.</p><p>It's better to hide the legend column and give more space to the actual chart. Here's how to do it.</p><p>Open <strong>Customizer</strong> &gt; <strong>Legend</strong> &gt; <strong>Position</strong> &gt; <strong>None</strong></p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QNnGZOQyy8jvbgUofYfupvXmu4.png""><h3>Step #6. Add Dependencies to Your Gantt chart</h3><p>Adding dependencies allows you to create a dynamic Gantt chart that updates in real time.</p><p>Dependencies here mean that tasks depend on one another's initiation or completion.</p><p>Using Google sheets formulas, you can easily map dependencies among tasks. Below we have explained three significant dependencies around Gantt charts.</p><h4>#1. End a Task to Start Another</h4><p>The dependency means a task can only be started once the previous task is completed. </p><p><strong>💭 Think about it:</strong> Which task can be completed before another can start?</p><p>For example, in our dataset, <em>Unit Tests</em> can only be started once <em>Designing </em>is complete. So here, Unit Tests (B5) depend on Designing (C4).</p><p>So we’ll put this formula in B5: <strong>=MAX(C4)+1</strong></p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/JHduzHIpis4pgIJOpts6C3Ie6so.png""><p>The date in B5 will automatically push one day further to the date of completion of the previous task. </p><h4>#2. Start a Task Before Ending Another</h4><p>In some cases, we start a task without ending the previous task. No kidding! We actually do that.</p><p>In fact, managers often do that because each task is interlinked in one way or another.</p><p>For instance, we might start the design tasks without ending the coding tasks because we may also require some coding from a design perspective.</p><p>In such dependencies, we create a buffer period for the previous task. So, we'll add this formula at the end date of the coding task (C2): <strong>=MIN(B4)+4</strong></p><p>Here, B4 is the start date of the dependent task, and +4 is the additional number of days the task will remain active after the initiation of another task.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/gEp420x0QsqkLRzf6efpm3jGRRk.png""><h4>#3. Finish to Finish</h4><p>In this, a task must finish in order to finish another.</p><p>As in our example, Improvements (C9) need extra days to complete even after final testing (C10).</p><p>You see, you might encounter a problem during final testing and choose to improve instead of launch.</p><p>In C9, use this formula: <strong>=MIN(C10)+1</strong></p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/G833A0LyMCELt2AExUnU7swvyk8.png""><p>This formula conveys that Improvements need one buffer day to finish after final testing is done and dusted.</p><h2>5 Free Gantt Chart Templates in Google Sheets</h2><h3>#1.

IT Project Gantt Chart</h3><p>An IT project Gantt chart functions similarly to a project management Gantt chart. The only differentiator is that this Gantt chart focuses primarily on managing IT projects.</p><p>That being said, IT project managers typically use it to show what work is scheduled to be done, when it is to be started and when it is expected to be completed. </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Wg6304frs0MwToR5y6rfUgd04.png""><p><strong>Template Link:</strong> <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19BO4d58wFBFc9yczragKSH978-l-hXdPze9T_U9Rjms/edit?usp=sharing"">IT Project Gantt Chart</a></p><p>Like any other chart, this specific IT project Gantt chart has four columns – task name, start date, end date, and duration. </p><p>And since the chart template is specific to IT, the tasks mentioned include wireframes, graphics, testing, optimization, etc.</p><p>Apart from the dataset, the Gantt chart is segmented into 4-5 milestones with specific dates and a brief description hooked to every milestone. </p><h3>#4. Event Marketing Gantt Chart</h3><p>An event marketing Gantt chart provides a visual timeline of your event plan. You can group tasks based on type, dependency, or priority and add a start and completion date to every other project.</p><p>Such kinds of Gantt charts are used by organizations and agencies that frequently conduct sponsored events, conferences, or meet ups.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/JjNLOwC4XfSUjgapTn5XZFGGyI.png""><p><strong>Template Link: </strong><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xOXkqTyewTBYowo92DPKhrCsTlOqZlxCe7KiUSuRP1o/edit?usp=sharing"">Event Marketing Gantt Chart</a></p><p>The convenient structure of this template and the stylish design make it great for planning and scheduling various projects.

Sales Management Gantt Chart</h3><p>As the name suggests, a sales Gantt chart is used by sales teams to graphically represent various sales activities under one roof. It also helps depict the performance of individual sales team members in every stage of the sales process.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hcc3RlgsR6xeQI60Bg4CsFSj7mo.png""><p><strong>Template Link: </strong><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ii9WymGvD2oc6xkkNg1Tm_gIboAx7uPPzDT7_3K4ndg/edit?usp=sharing"">Sales Management Gantt Chart</a></p><p>This sales Gantt chart depicts the performance of a sales manager in five stages:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Acquaintance:</strong> Create a basis for an exchange relationship</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Identifying customer needs: </strong>Time required to identify customer needs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Time needed to pitch and present the customer with the product</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Closing the deal:</strong> Actual time taken to close deals every quarter</p></li></ul><h2>Drawbacks of Creating Charts with Sheets </h2><h3>#1. Not a Mobile-friendly Platform</h3><p>Google sheets might seem like one, but it isn't a mobile-friendly platform.</p><p>Although it does offer a dedicated mobile app, the process becomes even more complicated compared to the web version, especially when creating Gantt charts.</p><p>Creating Gantt charts requires you to input formulas and perform numerous calculations on the go. Things get worse when you need to do all these with a poor navigational design and weakly-optimized mobile responsiveness.</p><p>Gsheets have both disadvantages. You may often find it exhausting to scroll through rows and columns. Plus, you may often encounter incomplete graphs needing you to scroll over and view them in two perfect halves.</p><p>Too much scrolling, right? In some time, we'll show you how Datapad (our tool) helps you overcome this issue.</p><h3>#2. Time Consuming &amp; Labour Intensive</h3><p>Similar to Excel, Gsheets is not a gen z tool.</p><p>Gen z prefers AI as an assistant or to automate things, unfortunately, Google sheets have next to no AI - processes. </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zKrXDX0zT3FiAOzHGdsJDwGZQpY.gif""><p>A step or another, you would be compelled to press, enter, click, or type the future action to create charts.</p><p>Like previously, you saw an intensive 6-step process on how to create a Gantt chart in Google sheets.</p><p>It's tough out there.😪</p><h3>#3. Might Slow Down When Processing Hefty Datasets</h3><p>Descending from a mighty-mighty company (Alphabet), Sheets aren't the first choice when dealing with complex datasets.</p><p>You may often face problematic situations like</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Mishandling of data</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Lags and glitches when scrolling or performing calculations</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Unresponsive sheets </p></li></ul><p>Besides, for companies dealing in terabytes of data, Google sheets automatically become a second choice to modern-day chart creation tools like Datapad.</p><p>Sheets, at max, offer <a href=""https://blog.golayer.io/google-sheets/google-sheets-limitations"">10,000,000 cells</a> for new and converted documents. Evidently, it needs 100,000X more cells to fit in a terabyte of data.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/rMvJzvrEjQM5uozBxrGBVoHM68E.gif""><h3>#4. Limited Customization Options</h3><p>Sheets has a customize tab but it offers limited options. You're limited to choosing from a set of pre-built charts which were last updated a decade ago.</p><p>Moreover, none of the charts turn out to be appreciated as stunning!</p><p>Simply put, charts prepared in Gsheets aren't aesthetically pleasing for viewers. And there's little you can do to enhance it.</p><p>Instead, as customizations, you can only edit the chart's fundamentals like title, fonts, text, and so on.</p><h2>Create Stunning Charts with Datapad</h2><p><br></p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eyY2EqHqnnwehgO83zVOJie4M2A.png""><p>Datapad is designed to make data analysis easier, especially for those using Google Sheets.

While the rest stare at Google asking - how do I make a line chart in google sheets?</p><p>But if you haven’t found your answers yet, you’re at the right place.</p><p>In this article, we’ll help you discover the various types of line charts and their best use cases. Moving forward, you’ll also learn how to do a line chart on Google Sheets and uncover a powerful tool to create line charts 5x faster and easier than Sheets.</p><p><em><strong>But before you get into the guide, here’s a TLDR if you’re short on time:</strong></em></p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>A line chart is a graphical representation showcasing changes in asset value over a specific time frame.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Google Sheets gives you an option of creating three types of line charts: Regular, Smooth, and Combo.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The process of creating line charts in Google Sheets is simple and short, however there’s a lot of manual process involved that make it time consuming.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Making a line chart in Google Sheets has a few drawbacks - it’s hard to create a chart on your mobile, tough to onboard and work with your team, might slow down when you lead a heavy dataset, etc.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Instead of dealing with all these drawbacks, try Datapad to create stunning line charts in no time.</p></li></ul><h2>What Is a Line Chart in Google Sheets?</h2><p>A line chart is a graphical representation showcasing changes in asset value over a specific time frame.</p><p>Simply put, this chart uses a series of dots connected via a singular line. Once these dots are connected, they become perfect for illustrating variations and determining trends of a series of data. </p><p>We emphasize the term <strong>'Individual'</strong> here because these charts are typically used for comparative analysis. For example, to identify change in sales or profit margins each month, quarter, or year. </p><p>Here’s how a line chart in Google Sheet look like:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/W5McPZodtAqcKaMYzQ81OoKjxk.png""><p>Besides, line charts help resolve a crucial debate between you and your stakeholders regarding differences.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wOEwakvFyVTObmEk7TC0Iwq71g.gif""><p>It may occur that the difference in sales numbers are minimal enough to go unnoticed through the naked eye. Here’s when Line Charts play a significant role.</p><p>These charts help you showcase even the tiniest variations happening in your daily or monthly sales numbers. That too in an easy-to-understand format.</p><p>What’s more, Gsheets help you compare large datasets using a variety of line charts.</p><p>Let's see the different line charts available and how to use chart in google sheets.</p><h2>What Are the Types of Line Charts in Google Sheets?</h2><p>You can find three types of Line Graphs in Sheets: Regular Line Chart, Smooth Line Chart, and Combine Line Chart.</p><h3>#1. Regular Line Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/4HXEdIFRASCLXSxYMf08cSeQ0U.png""><p>A regular line chart is the most basic of all line charts. It displays information as a series of dots and then connects them with a single line to help notice trends without stressing the eyes.</p><h4>Regular Line Charts Best Use Case</h4><p>These charts are a popular choice among data analysts to visualize the comparison between two or more datasets of similar categories. </p><p>Some of its best use cases include:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Comparing monthly device sales (mobiles, tablets, laptops)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Monitoring securities or stock market trends (day-to-day variations)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Analyzing project progress</p></li></ul><h3>#2. Smooth Line Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0ramOARkgOg7aOCeccw2dgSOtM.png""><p>These charts are similar to regular line charts; it's just they don't exhibit pin-pointed curves. Instead, they use curvy lines to connect dots allowing free movement of your eyeballs while analyzing the graph.</p><p>This, however, has called for a boycott of the chart. </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/KfQvhFQI5dyRT78q0YJjK5HC2BQ.gif""><p><em>Why?</em></p><p>Most marketers feel it's unconventional to use curved lines to visualize data.</p><p>At some level, they're right – curved lines have a larger diameter on the pivots causing misinterpretation of accurate data values. </p><p>But there are some typical use cases where smooth line charts can be of use.</p><h4>Smooth Line Chart Best Use Case</h4><p>A smooth Line Chart is suitable for representing long-term data.</p><p>Like below, we've presented a 12-months product sales report via Smooth Line Chart. A regular line chart here won’t be as soothing to the eyes as a smooth line chart is.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/TWxzPWKEmDFEpV7V6lHw0H4sgE.png""><p>You can also use it for comparing financial trends or showing changes in the price of two similar stocks over the year.</p><p><strong>Industry Advice: </strong>Avoid using smooth line charts for visualizing smaller datasets as it causes more confusion than providing insights.</p><h3>#3. Combo Line Chart</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/HVZ1mNB6hYJQtzV5dwONMrmUs.png""><p>Combo line charts use a combination of two charts, line charts and bar charts, to display two or more different datasets under one roof. The line is used like a trend line that shows if the overall graph is increasing or decreasing.</p><p>In the above image, we presented three datasets using a combo chart: Sales from product A, Sales from product B, and the total number of products sold every month.</p><h4>Combo Line Charts Best Use Case</h4><p>Combo line charts are of best use when you want to display your research and set of data in a single chart. For example, traders and stock analysts use combo line charts to compare the historical and present performance of stocks.</p><p><strong>💭Food for Thought:</strong> How easy is it to view monthly sales from products and the total number of products sold under the same graph instead of juggling through two different chart types on two separate sheets?</p><p>But the question which remains unan11swered is, ""how do you make a line chart in Google sheets?” 🤔</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>You can even have multiple lines in the line chart and get a comparison graph such as the image below.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/2LQRyiF88abZR55pJFdxKhzGA.png""><p>In the next section, we've curated an easy-to-follow step-by-step guide to help you create line charts in minutes.</p><h2>How to Make a Line Chart in Google Sheets?</h2><h3>Step 1: Prepare a Dataset</h3><p>Ask yourself - What numbers do you want to visualize through the line chart? Is it monthly or quarterly, or annually?</p><p>You need to feed data into the system to present it. And sometimes, a lot of it. 🤯</p><p>So, if you've got an existing dataset saved in your system, you can easily import it to Sheets and escape from the double work. </p><p>Here's how you can do it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The steps are from after opening Sheets on your system.</p><p>Click on <strong>File</strong> &gt;<strong> Import</strong>, and select the file consisting of the dataset.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/fecwgXehMrIzNh9zvuEyDxzAyQ.png""><p>Or if you've a smaller dataset, you can manually enter it too. It won't take much longer.</p><p>In fact, we manually entered a dummy dataset of our monthly sales database for Q1 and Q2 of 2022👇🏻</p><p>In this, each column represents different values of the same category - <em>Product</em>.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Column A:</strong> Associate values with specific time frames</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Column B:</strong> Sales from Product A</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Column C:</strong> Sales from Product B</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Column D:</strong> Total products sold in a month</p></li></ul><p>Moving forward, we'll use this dataset to learn how to create line charts in Google sheets.</p><h3>Step 2: Select the Dataset You Want to Visualize</h3><p>Visualizing every data column you have in your sheet isn't necessary.</p><p>So if the dataset has extra columns that you don't want to visualize at this time, then this step is for you.</p><p>From our dataset, we wanted to visualize columns A, B, and C for the moment. So we selected just that part.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wNhQrk7fTXhgYlgZESzvtrKJtpA.png""><h3>Step 3: Insert a Line Chart</h3><p>After selecting the columns, click on the <strong>Insert</strong> option in the top menu bar, then click on the <strong>Chart option</strong> in the drop-down menu.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oPQlTrn7rD7FrM88AgFzo4ISSKc.png""><p>Gsheets will present the data in a default chart type (this is what Google thinks is the best way to visualize the available data).</p><p>For our dataset, Sheets automatically visualized our data using a bar chart.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/thy4a2V094jjFEXiy99DjI8GzhM.png""><p>However, we'll anyway convert it to a line chart, because this guide is all about that!</p><p>To do so, double-click on your chart to open <strong>Chart Editor</strong> on the right sidebar.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/dCqZuSh8cpXZ9UlTnmP7MnJiqo.png""><p>From here, click on the <strong>Chart Type</strong> drop-down to open doors to various data visualization elements provided by Sheets.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/OS01Ofm32OCYZ7EGomf55NapEZc.png""><p>Luckily, Line Charts are the first type of charts visible on the list. There are three options in the ""line charts'' section that you can choose from:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Regular Line Chart</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Smooth Line Chart</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Combo Line Chart</p></li></ol><p>We've described the use cases of each of these sets above, so choose accordingly.</p><p>Once you've made a choice, click on the chart icon, and your chosen line chart will replace your default chart in real-time.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/VYIu7R67ViVWpyazasCVW7srj8.png""><p>Before you google how to set up a line chart in Google Sheets, hop into the next section.</p><h3>Step 4: Setting Up Your Line Chart</h3><p>You can set up the chart from the same section you changed the chart type in the previous step.</p><p>Below the chart type option, you can choose to change the data range, x-axis (horizontal axis) and y-axis (vertical axis) title, series, or switch rows and columns.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PuBFzraXy8dkR6oT52FATC0ajsE.png""><p>And that’s not just it, you can even change the font size and style of the axis titles. To customize your line charts, click on <strong>Customize </strong>in the chart editor.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5p3Yk5gb1DiJ1IXbWGNoXVwJ2M.svg""><p>In the customize tab, you can find options to customize background colors, style, labels, and colors.</p><p>Once you're done with customizations (if any), your line chart is ready to be presented.</p><p>So, now that you have a better understanding of how to create a line chart in Google Sheets. It's time to share our creativity with teams and stakeholders.</p><h3>Bonus Step: Export or Share Charts</h3><p>Instead of keeping the line chart you make to yourself, share it with your team, investors, and execs. To begin with, click on <strong>File </strong>in the top menu bar, you'll see three ways to share your chart:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>👨‍👦‍👦 Share:</strong> Enter the email addresses of people you want to allow access to your sheet</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>📩 Email:</strong> Directly email the sheet to teammates and stakeholders</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>⬇Download:</strong> Make an offline copy of the sheet (doc, pdf, or .csv formats) to use later on</p></li></ul><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zyTzGrfB910a28KX4JnfEyPP1A.png""><h2>Drawbacks of Creating Charts with Sheets</h2><h3>#1. Limited Number of Integrations</h3><p>Unlike most chart creation software or tools, Sheets offer next to no integration options.</p><p>You see, there are at most two ways to import data:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>By importing a pre-built datasheet from the drive/system</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>By manually entering data in cells</p></li></ul><p>This also means there's a high chance that the data you use for creating charts is outdated. And there's no quick solution to visualize real-time data until and unless you enter and update it manually every time.</p><p>Sounds like you need to hire someone to do this regularly! 😥</p><h3>#2. Might Get Slow When Handling Complex Datasets</h3><p>Another drawback of Sheets is its inability to process big datasets. </p><p>Yes, despite being among Google's core services, the application needs to catch up in processing complex and lengthy data.</p><p>Sheets provide over <a href=""https://blog.golayer.io/google-sheets/google-sheets-limitations"">10,000,000 cells</a> to collect and organize data. However, long before you hit rock bottom, you'll encounter lags and glitches in your worksheet. 🐌</p><p>Some users even cite frequent unresponsive pages when dealing with large datasets in Sheets. And this becomes problematic for large companies that generally deal with terabytes of user data.</p><p>When such companies use Gsheets, they are constantly under threat of data security and integrity.</p><h3>#3. Mobile App Is Not Up to the Mark</h3><p>Using the software to create charts on your mobile is a big NO. And here's why:</p><p>Even though Gsheets offer a dedicated mobile app for mobile users, it hasn't worked smartly to optimize the app for small-screen devices.</p><p>Or we could say it has no such feature to be counted as well-optimized for mobile users. </p><p>You might end up in one or the other situation listed below:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Difficult to scroll through the sheet</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Bugged/incomplete graphs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Complications in managing and visualizing data</p></li></ul><h3>#4. Limited Customization Options</h3><p>Compared to Datapad (our tool), Google Sheets offers a limited range of data visualization elements. </p><p>Although Sheets provide a pre-built set of charts, tables, graphs, and widgets to visualize data, these elements are limited in numbers and are not aesthetically pleasing to the eyes.</p><p>Of course, you can edit and customize the charts, but then again, options are scarce, and ultimately the result won't make you go <strong>WOW</strong>.</p><p>So, what's a better way to create charts?</p><p>Looks like we got an answer for you. 🤩👇🏻</p><h2>Create Stunning Line Charts with Datapad!</h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eyY2EqHqnnwehgO83zVOJie4M2A.png""><p>Datapad is designed to make data analysis easier, especially for those using Google Sheets.

They communicate to the program what information needs to go inside the pie chart.</p><p>For instance, in our dataset, we have placed the data labels we desire in each slice of the pie in column A.</p><p>And then, in columns B and C, we added the numeric values we wanted to represent through the pie chart.</p><h3>Step 2: Create a Pie Chart from Your Database</h3><p>Now that we have a dataset let's learn how to insert a pie chart in Google Sheets.</p><p>To get started, select the dataset (columns) you want to visualize.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/E3UgD86LgFlDfTvYNpzyQvAtA.png""><p>Then click on Insert in the menu bar. </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/e7iCivACpwLbSRPpoHRjjT1kE.png""><p>A drop-down appears with a list of customization. Click on <strong>Chart</strong> to visualize your dataset.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/8aPYpMKf99yjYLwxrDMewFTKJ2I.png""><p>Google Sheets presents you with a default chart type to visualize your data as it did for our dataset 👇🏻 </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/siICJQLAZmqpHOGYeFNutvWj9I8.png""><p>However, you can always change the chart type as you desire. To do so, click on <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the top right corner of your default chart.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BswH2hLR9ewtqa33hZedbtNHuw.png""><p>The Google Sheets in-built chart editor opens up on the right side of your sheet.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>You can also double-click on the chart to open the editor directly.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/3u0mWPx9ixmREIfpejBgCvUwRhE.png""><p>Now, using the chart editor’s customize tab, you get access to plenty of ways to set up and customize your default chart type.</p><p>Let's first change the default chart type to a pie chart.</p><p>To do so, click on the <strong>Chart Type</strong> drop-down, scroll down a gallery of pre-built chart types, and halt near the <strong>Pie Chart</strong> section.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/J3kOkc8oJp361uvTBdoZ8eNJBM.png""><p>Here you're offered three pie chart options:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>General Pie Chart: </strong>A simple pie chart divided into slices with labels and values</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Doughnut Pie Chart:</strong> Similar to a pie chart, but can contain more than one data series</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>3D Pie Chart</strong>: A 3-dimensional illustration of a pie chart</p></li></ul><p>Click on your preferred chart type, and there you go!</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nF9cQK6nh8Yi3ulvB8qKNdZXfYk.png""><p>Now that you know how to insert a pie chart in Google Sheets, let's now understand <strong>how to set up a pie chart on Google Sheets</strong>.</p><h3>Step 3: Set up Your Charts As per Your Preference</h3><p>In the same section of the chart editor, right below the chart type drop-down, you will see setup elements like data range, labels, and values.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZkKndQklqH5fx4wQQZUKPQuOXV0.png""><p>Let's explore how each one serves the purpose. </p><h4>#1. Date Range</h4><p>Google Sheets is a dear friend of its novice users.</p><p>So even if you have visualized the wrong cells by mistake, you don't need to redo the whole process. </p><p>You can simply click on the <strong>select data range</strong> icon and change the existing data range or add another for visualization.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/E8cHudn665S49Rzdql1U9bS1M.png""><h4>#2. Labels</h4><p>Using this section, you can change the labels of your pie chart. For example, in our pie chart, we have used <em>Region</em> as a label to present data on the chart.</p><p>However, you can choose to represent your pie chart using Sales numbers or other data categories (if any).</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FK7ZD5NBWExXSzundrkmDHpMApY.png""><p>‍</p><h4>#3. Values</h4><p>Values, here, mean the values you want to display on a pie slice.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/VShpAwC9iihFJ6ZkQu7aMOQMQ.png""><p> </p><p>If we want to display another value on the slices, let's say we want to show <em>% increase in sales</em> as values on every slice. We'll click on the below title, and here's how it will go👇🏻</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eG3feuK0CxZZR44RnqbSezQHug.png""><p><strong>Note:</strong> You must have another column with values in your dataset to get this option.</p><p>So until now, we saw how to create and set up a pie chart. In the next section, we’ll explore how to edit pie chart in Google Sheets.</p><h3>Step 4: Customize Your Pie Chart to Make It Look Better</h3><p>In the chart editor, there's a <strong>Customize</strong> option beside the Setup menu. Right here👇🏻</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/qRHl6g4uu7bgp1CbRIKl2aeIOx4.png""><p>From here, you can customize every neck of the woods of your chart. Let's drill down the elements in the customizer one by one. </p><h4>#1. Chart Style</h4><p>Use the chart style section to custom format your pie chart's font style, background color, and borderline colors. </p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zXIFnlLok3Emqy1HdjgqTAyJo.png""><p>Furthermore, you can also change the look and dimensions of your pie chart by ticking <strong>Maximize</strong> and <strong>3D</strong> check boxes.</p><h4>#2. Pie Chart</h4><p>This section offers some outlandish customizations. Like, you can put a doughnut hole in your pie chart. Yup, we're damn serious! 😮</p><p>Even though you opted for a general pie chart type, Gsheets still allow you to transform your chart into a doughnut pie chart.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Donut Hole</strong> drop-down and choose the percentage (area) of the hole.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QuHzHM2sGTouoHc0cKNqffx7Yc.png""><p>For instance, in our pie chart, we opted for <strong>50%</strong>, and here's how it looks.</p><p>‍</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/UdAF14wKeQO6iIzDjK6LYsLvCpY.png""><p>Additionally, you can use the <strong>Slice Label</strong> drop-down to add labels/values/percentages to every pie chart slice. For example, we added Value to every slice, and here's what we got.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/6B65NwSHbUx5KuaWhtApBnlPJ5I.png""><p><strong>💭Food for thought:</strong> Isn't the pie chart getting better with every step?</p><h4>#3. Pie Slice</h4><p>From this section, you change the color of every slice in the pie chart.</p><p>Simply select a <strong>Slice</strong> &gt; <strong>Pick a color</strong>, and it'll be displayed in real-time.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/i3r0peopIoIA0KVUuYjCtZ9HPLE.png""><p>Now let's understand how to change title of a pie chart in Google Sheets.</p><h4>#4. Chart &amp; Axis Titles</h4><p>This section is all about it! From here, you can edit the chart titles and subtitles. Plus, you can even customize the font style, size, format, and colors.</p><h4>#5. Legend</h4><p>A legend helps you add meaning to your chart. </p><p>Let's be real, what's the purpose of creating a pie chart if we add too much text to explain it?</p><p>Let's take an example.</p><p>Previously our chart legend positioning was set on Auto or Labeled, and the chart looked like this.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/qUF7eH9ES28f0KLZaOeg5S80i9g.png""><p>Then we changed the positioning to the Bottom, and you can see the difference.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/CXooCvVk74JvAyyQ10Skx7kLfUQ.png""><p>Moving forward, you can also change the legend font style, size, format, and color.</p><p>And that's the end of the ladder. You have successfully learned how do you make a pie chart on Google Sheets.</p><h3>Bonus Step: Export/Share a Pie Chart</h3><p>You can share/export your pie chart in two ways: <strong>Online and Offline.</strong></p><p>To share it offline, click on <strong>File</strong> in the top left corner of the menu bar.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mNFmdv1LAU9waZZtS75gs9YivfA.png""><p>Then hover over <strong>Download</strong> to explore various downloading formats like Microsoft Excel, PDF, or CSV formats.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QJYduM7IkfjMUlBZ9N5RWJ3pn0.png""><p>Or, a better way is to Email the sheet to your stakeholders or team members directly.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7EZqcawX5PNMMdw9MzkLSno2w.png""><h2>Drawbacks of Creating Pie Charts with Sheets</h2><p>Although creating pie charts with Sheets is no rocket science, the process does involve certain limitations, such as:</p><h3>#1. Hard to Create on the Go</h3><p>With Sheets, the process of creating pie charts gets complicated as the screen size reduces.</p><p>You see, although Gsheets offers a dedicated mobile app for users, doing the same process you just did on a laptop or PC would be difficult.</p><p>This is mainly because the UI/UX needs to be better optimized to be used on the go. You might often find it challenging to edit charts or encounter half-volley graphs in your Gsheet mobile app.</p><h3>#2. Time-Consuming</h3><p>Unlike Datapad (our tool), Google Sheets offer limited automation. It's evident to you by the 5-step process we have discussed above.</p><p>Although the process is easy-to-do, at the same time, it's lengthy and time-consuming.</p><p>In fact, in sheets, data validation and preparation is labor-intensive, i.e., you need to manually double-check and re-enter any incorrect information.</p><p><strong>P.S. </strong>No wonder why it took so long for data analysts and marketers to visualize data via spreadsheets or even Google Sheets.</p><h3>#3. Isn't Aesthetically Pleasing </h3><p>Of all the data visualizations provided by Gsheets, no one stands to be called 'stunning' or 'beautiful.'</p><p>Harsh but true!</p><p>Simply put, pie charts prepared in Gsheets aren't aesthetically pleasing for viewers. Factually, this was a major pain point considering which dashboarding tools like Datapad were created.</p><p>Datapad comparably offers much better, stunning, and pixel-perfect data visualization elements. Moreover, you can easily customize the look and feel of your charts using the in-built drag-and-drop builder.</p><p>So your chart look typically relies on your design perception. </p><h3>#4. Database Limitations</h3><p>Most of us think that Sheets allow unlimited data storage.</p><p>Well, we don't disagree entirely. Gsheets offer a sufficient number of cells to collect and store databases of small companies that deal in tens and thousands of data.</p><p>However, at the same time, when dealing with millions and trillions of terabytes of data (which is typical for large-sized enterprises in today's data-driven world), Sheets won't be the right fit for you.</p><p><a href=""https://blog.golayer.io/google-sheets/google-sheets-limitations"">As per reports</a>, Google Sheets limits you to 10,000,000 cells for new and converted documents.</p><h2>Create Stunning Charts with Datapad</h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eyY2EqHqnnwehgO83zVOJie4M2A.png""><p>Datapad is designed to make data analysis easier, especially for those using Google Sheets.

Yes, someone has to say it! 🤷♂️</p><p>They are the most fundamental chart type used by business owners and financial analysts to display complicated data in an easy-to-read format.</p><p>Besides, they are a convenient way to visualize information quickly and effectively.</p><p>In this article, we will walk you through on how to make bar graphs in Google Sheets.</p><p>Let’s start with answering the most basic question.</p><h2>What are Bar Graphs in Google Sheets?</h2><p>A bar graph is a graphical representation that uses a combination of bars and numeric values to present complex data in an easy-to-understand manner.</p><p>Simply put, a bar graph <em>(aka bar charts or column graphs)</em> plots numeric values against levels of rectangular blocks known as bars.</p><p>These <strong>levels</strong> are plotted on one chart axis (let's say the x-axis) and <strong>values</strong> on the other axis (y-axis). Each value claims one bar, and the height of each bar corresponds to the value they represent.</p><p>Here's how a typical bar graph looks in Google Sheets.</p><p>‍</p><img alt=""google sheets bar graph example"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/n2c3ZSowAEIuU0QuVIrjyhk4JYw.png""><p>Moreover, as you can see in the image, bars are plotted on a common baseline to allow for easy measurement and comparison of values.</p><p>This is just one type of bar graph. Google Sheets, however, offers you an array of bar chart styles to visualize data.</p><h3>#1. Horizontal Bar Graphs</h3><img alt=""Horizontal sales bar graph"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/sPYbNJBikoUFLxmshLjLHs2p8gI.png""><p>In these types of bar graphs, the rectangular bars are horizontally drawn on the y-axis, and the x-axis shows the value corresponding to each bar.</p><h3>#2. Vertical Bar Graphs</h3><p>Unlike horizontal bar graphs, here, the rectangular bars are vertically drawn on the x-axis, and the y-axis shows the value corresponding to each bar.</p><h3>#3. Stacked Bar Chart</h3><img alt=""google sheets stacked bar chart"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/UA4gij9vJ66hJSJ0pQYE80NbMs.png""><p>The stacked bar graph (or composite bar graph) divides the whole bar into several segments. Each segment is colored and labeled differently to quickly identify individual categories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>#4. 100% Stacked Bar Graph</h3><img alt=""100% Stacked Bar Graph"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Ah4Fj9lCnqSHVQUrlFsMY2wGMjg.png""><p>Similar to stacked bar graphs, this graph also splits the bar into colored segments based on different categories. The only difference is, in a 100% stacked bar graph, the stacked bar always equals 100%, i.e., each bar height is always 100%.</p><h2>Why and When to Use Bar Graphs?</h2><p><strong>💭 Food For Thought:</strong> Bar graphs are the best way of data handling while working on Google Sheets.</p><p>It's an excellent tool to represent data that are independent of one another and that don't need to be in any specific order for being represented.</p><p>Besides, bar graphs are especially used when you want to show a distribution of data points or compare performance over time.</p><p>From a bar chart, we can see which groups are the highest or most common and how the groups compare against each other.</p><p>But what makes bar graphs popular among data analysts compared to other charts?</p><p>Here are the reasons for it.</p><h3>#1. They’re Easy to Read and Understand</h3><p>Because bar graphs are widely used in publishable formats like textbooks, marketing reports, and research papers, many people already know how it works and what it represents.</p><p>We mean, it's ok if a higher-secondary school kid tells you the information that a bar graph conveys. It's that common and easy to grasp.</p><p>Unlike other types of graphs, such as <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/how-to-make-a-pie-chart-in-google-sheets"">pie charts</a>, histograms, and area charts, bar graphs are really straightforward. Its simplicity makes it a good choice when you want to make your data understandable to a diversified audience segment.&nbsp;</p><h3>#2. Perfect for Mapping Changes Overtime</h3><p>Another prolific advantage of bar graphs is their ability to visualize trends in an easy-to-understand format.</p><p>Other graphs, such as pie charts, can only represent one data set (mostly).</p><p>For instance, if you’re conducting a yearly survey with 100 people asking them their choice of smartphone and then showing the percentage of people opting for different preferences, you need some form of visual aid to express it.&nbsp;</p><p>In such cases, a bar graph could be handy to show how people's choices change over time. Anyone can look at the chart and identify which smartphone is people's choice for the current year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, you can also compare that information to past surveys and analyze trends to map the changes in trends over time.</p><p>Until now, you might have figured out why using a bar graph to visualize your data can be a wise choice.&nbsp;</p><p>So, let's skip to the good part.&nbsp;</p><div><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/adultswim-show-me-good-stuff-it-off-SWdNAbwRVQbODxsi4g"">via GIPHY</a></div><h2>How to Make Bar Graphs in Google Sheets?</h2><p>Although making a bar graph in Google Sheets is no rocket science, it might be a cumbersome process for newbies.

You have customized every section of the bar graph and created a full-fledged bar graph in Google Sheets.&nbsp;</p><p>Achievement Unlocked! 🎉</p><p>You might have felt there are tons of customizations available on G Sheets for creating data visualizations, but the truth is that Google Sheets is far behind in visualizing KPIs.</p><p>Here’s why!</p><h2>Drawbacks of Monitoring KPIs with Google Sheets</h2><h3>#1. Limited Automation</h3><p>Despite being a product of Google, it's uncommon to find that G Sheets provide next to no automation.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with the data extraction and management process, Google Sheets doesn’t provide any helpful automation. Instead, you are required to manually input and edit data to your Google Sheet dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>That sounds tedious and is actually tiring.</p><h3>#2. Hard to Onboard Your Whole Team</h3><p>If you’re tracking metrics with your team, things can get messy because someone can tamper the sheet, or everyone can keep their own version which breaks the single source of truth.</p><p>What’s worse, Google Sheets slows down once there are too many collaborators accessing the sheets at the same time. Besides, it has a comparably poor UI for efficiently managing team activities.</p><p>Some standard dashboarding features like assigning tasks, real-time communication, time tracking, and accounting for internal databases cannot be achieved with Google Sheets dashboards.</p><p>Everything adds up to the fact that Google Sheets is not a team-friendly tool.</p><h3>#3. Bad Mobile Experience&nbsp;</h3><p>What if you want to check your metrics on the go? Let's be honest. Google Sheets aren't a great choice for it.</p><p>You see, dashboards created on Gsheets are not mobile-friendly. Although you can access them from your mobile, it still requires you to pinch your phone every time to navigate through your dashboard.</p><p>There are also chances of unintentionally hampering the data and dashboard layout when working through an unresponsive mobile interface.&nbsp;</p><p>So what can you do?&nbsp;</p><p>You can try one of the best alternatives to Google Sheets.👇🏻</p><h2>Creating Charts on Excel is Time-Consuming: Here’s How You Can Do it Better for Free with Datapad</h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eyY2EqHqnnwehgO83zVOJie4M2A.png""><p>Datapad is designed to make data analysis easier, especially for those using Google Sheets.

Why Should You Track KPIs? 	What Are the Benefits of KPI Tracking? 	What Are the Key KPIs Every Business Should Be Tracking?  &nbsp;How to Set Up A KPI Tracking Dashboard in 5 Steps? &nbsp;  &nbsp;Wrapping Up &nbsp; </div><img alt=""kpi tracking"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/q2T0HIUf4ADBSCcId3SVvcy5ndk.png""><p>Successful business leaders must ensure all of their departments in the company succeed financially and operationally. To achieve that, they measure some key elements that demonstrate the effectiveness of a company in achieving its business objectives. </p><p>However, there's no specific rule for what KPIs you should track and for how long. These decisions are tied to your company's objectives and goals.</p><p>For example, KPIs like annual revenue, net profit, or employee tenure reflect the company's long-term growth. Therefore, you might be willing to track them yearly, just so it becomes easy to compare with historical data and predict future trends.</p><p>On the other hand, some KPIs like customer retention rate or conversion rate are preferably tracked every month.</p><p>That's because these KPIs yield better insights when compared every month. Thereby allowing you to adjust your strategies in real-time without derailing from your long-term goals.</p><p>But, one question that sticks around is why tracking KPIs is important; can't we just keep going and keep increasing our revenue without the need to track KPIs?</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/what-is-a-kpi""><strong> What is KPI?: Beginners Guide You Have Been Looking For</strong></a></p><div><br></div><h2>Why KPI Monitoring is Important?</h2><p>Though there are several reasons why monitoring KPIs is important, here are some of the most important ones:</p><h3>#1. Measures Progress Over Time</h3><p>KPIs consist of quantifiable data, and tracking them helps you make the right business strategies and improve operating practices.</p><p>By tracking KPIs correctly, you know exactly how much business you have done monthly, the recurring revenue, how customers respond to changes you make, and many more things that are crucial to keeping the business running.</p><h3>#2. Improves Performance Efficiency</h3><p>Tracking KPIs lets you analyze different patterns over time which can help draw valuable insights so that the overall performance of that segment goes up.</p><p>For example, if your revenue goes down from $100,000 to $80,000, tracking multiple KPIs like abandonment rate (if you own an ecommerce business), subscription losses, and net promoter score can tell you exactly why your revenue went down.</p><p>This way, you can optimize your website for a specific KPI and increase performance efficiency over time.&nbsp;</p><h3>#3. Making Informed Decisions</h3><p>With the right KPIs, you have the right information at your fingertips. That helps solve problems and make informed decisions when you are stuck in a lump.</p><h3>#4. Personal Growth</h3><p>Not all goals you set will be met. However, with the KPI tracking, you will always be encouraged to learn why certain things did not work as you intended. This creates a learning environment for team members and fosters personal growth.&nbsp;</p><div><br></div><h2>What Are the Benefits of KPI Tracking?</h2><p>The benefits of KPIs go way beyond only tracking and monitoring revenue figures. Here's how your organization can benefit from tracking KPIs:</p><h3>#1. Increases Employee Engagement</h3><p>Companies usually struggle with employee engagement, which can directly influence your business and overall growth.&nbsp;</p><p>KPIs swoop in here by providing a helpful mechanism to measure performance directly linked to employee engagement. This results in an engaged workforce that sees higher customer engagement and profitability.</p><p>On top of that, KPIs can also be linked to incentives like giving monthly bonuses to someone who secures the most sales. This way, you can encourage and empower the employees to hit the target more often.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>#2. Improves Decision Quality</h3><p>KPIs help in making informed decisions. For example, suppose there's a dip in your web traffic. Instead of jumping to random conclusions like perhaps the content is poor, or you should do the SEO right, you can look at the traffic source metrics and make better decisions to solve the problem.</p><h3>#3. Analyzes Patterns Over Time</h3><p>KPIs detect patterns over time which can be beneficial in solving key problems holding your growth.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, suppose your social media engagement remains low during a certain season.&nbsp;</p><p>In that case, KPIs will let you analyze the pattern so that you can design a social media campaign for that particular season or stay away from social media for that specific month(s).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><br></div><h2>What Are the Key KPIs Every Business Should Be Tracking?</h2><h3>#1. Total Revenue</h3><p>Total revenue is the overall income generated by the sales of goods and services by a company over a specific period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the formula to measure it:</p><p><strong>Total revenue =</strong> Number of units sold X Cost per unit</p><p>It’s a very simple way to determine how a company brings in money from its core operations before any expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>That makes it one of the key KPIs to be tracked as it evaluates the company's broader growth.</p><h3>#2. Net Profit Margin</h3><p>Net Profit Margin measures the effectiveness of your business in generating profit on each dollar of revenue your business brings in.</p><p>The result of the Net Profit Margin is calculated as:</p><p><strong>Net Profit Margin =</strong> Net Profit / Total Revenue X 100</p><p>The Net Profit Margin is essential for a company in:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Measuring the profitability of a business</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Making long and short-term financial decisions</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Keeping you ahead of your competitors in price battles</p></li></ul><p>A higher Net Profit Margin signifies a growing business; if the margin decreases, consider it a red flag and act upon it ASAP.</p><h3>#3. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h3><p>It becomes essentially important in a business to know how much you spend to acquire a new customer.&nbsp;</p><p>CAC is a fundamental metric that monitors the aggregate cost incurred by a business in acquiring a new customer.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a popular barometer to measure the health of the growth among new-age startups and internet-based companies.</p><p>CAC is measured by a simple formula:</p><p><strong>CAC = </strong>(Sales cost + Marketing cost) / New customers</p><p>CAC is an important KPI that lets you know which segments are most profitable and efficient. It’s often regarded as one of the most important metrics used by investors to evaluate the scalability of a business.</p><h3>#4. Customer Lifetime Value(CLV)</h3><p>CLV estimates how much a customer will contribute to your business for the duration of your relationship with that individual.</p><p>You can measure CLV using the formula:</p><p><strong>CLV = </strong>(Customer Value X Average Customer Lifespan)</p><p>Where Customer Value = Average purchase value X Number of purchases</p><p>We know it sounds like putting a monetary value on your customers. However, it’s much more than that.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the biggest advantages is it improves customer retention and avoids customer attrition. In addition, measuring CLV allows you to make a more informed marketing decision that saves extra costs and increases overall profitability.</p><h3>#5. Gross Margin</h3><p>Gross Margin is net sales minus the cost of sold goods. It tells how much money a company retains after incurring direct costs used in manufacturing the product, excluding taxes and payrolls.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gross margin = </strong>Net sales - COGS (cost of goods sold)</p><p>Where Net sales is the total money that came from sales for a particular period.</p><p>Gross margin isn't a key indicator in determining a company's profitability. However, companies use gross margin to evaluate the relationship between their cost of production and revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>It also helps companies to evaluate their management. A high gross margin indicates effective management in generating revenues based on direct production costs.</p><h3>#6. Customer Loyalty and Retention</h3><p>A study by <a href=""https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/the-economics-of-e-loyalty"">Harvard Business School</a> revealed that increasing customer retention by 5% increases the profit by 25 - 95%. That makes customer retention one of the most important, if not the most important KPI to track.</p><p>To calculate customer retention rate, you can use the formula:</p><p><strong>CRR= </strong>((E - N ) / S) / 100</p><p>Where S is the number of customers at the beginning, E is the number of customers at the end, and N is the time period of acquisition.</p><p>Loyal customers are more profitable. Thus, tracking CRR helps increase sales by reducing the extra cost of customer acquisition.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, old customers are likely to give more feedback on various products and services offered, allowing the company to improve faster.</p><h3>#7. Net Promoter Score</h3><p>A net promoter score indicates a customer's willingness to refer a product and service to their fellows. It's based on the results of a survey that asks customers to rate how likely they would recommend a brand to someone on a scale of 0-10.</p><p><strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS) =</strong> Percentage of Detractor - Percentage of Promoter&nbsp;</p><p>NPS is one of the most important metrics which gives insights into customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. Moreover, tracking NPS leaves you primed to identify customers' pain points, resulting in higher revenue growth.</p><h3>#8. Qualified Leads Per Month</h3><p>Simply betting on leads won't tell the whole story about whether they will convert or not.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s why measuring the quality of leads is an important thing to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>Qualified leads is the ultimate KPI that tells how many leads are contributing to the sales so that you can improve your lead generation strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can use this formula to work it out:</p><p><strong>Qualifies Lead =</strong> Total Sales / Total leads</p><p>With an effective lead qualification method, you should achieve higher conversion rates and significantly lower your acquisition costs.</p><h3>#9. Lead-to-Client Conversion Ratio</h3><p>Lead-to-client conversion rate is a critical metric that tells how a company converts qualified leads into customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Calculating lead-to-client conversion rate is a bit tricky. Every company has its own unique definition of conversion, and thus it's necessary to define the conversion before calculating the metric.</p><p>Mathematically it can be expressed as a ratio:</p><p><strong>Lead-to-client conversion rate =</strong> (Qualified leads that resulted in sales / qualified leads)&nbsp;</p><p>Sales representatives mainly use this metric to evaluate the success of converting potential customers to actual customers. Moreover, it also tells about the effectiveness of various marketing channels of the campaign.</p><h3>#10. Monthly Website Traffic</h3><p>As the name suggests, monthly website traffic indicates the source of traffic on the website over a period of time which can be:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Organic Traffic:</strong> Those who land on your website by searching for it (organic search)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Inorganic Traffic:</strong> Those who land on your website by clicking ads&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>If you want to calculate the monthly website traffic growth from January to February sessions, here's how to do it:</p><p><strong>Monthly website traffic = </strong>(Feb sessions - Jan sessions) / Jan sessions</p><p>This will give you the change in website traffic from January to February.</p><p>You can double down on the marketing channel that's working well by monitoring traffic growth. Moving ahead, calculating monthly website traffic can also help you refine your business strategy and expand your product line based on the analytics.&nbsp;</p><h3>#11. Quick Ratio</h3><p>The Quick ratio shows the ratio of gains in revenue to your revenue loss. It’s the coefficient of growth for an organization, as it incorporates all the essential elements into one number to understand the company’s growth.&nbsp;</p><p>You can calculate the quick ratio with a simple formula:</p><p><strong>Quick Ratio = </strong>New MRR + Expansion MRR / Churned MRR</p><p>Where MRR is the monthly recurring revenue</p><p>Tracking the quick ratio of your company allows you to understand your company in a better way. It also gives a glimpse into how the different sectors of your business like marketing, sales, and customer management are doing.</p><h3>#12. Return Over Investment (ROI)</h3><p>Whether you’re an investor or a shareholder, you want your every bet to bring a high return on investment. It expresses the profitability of a company. In plain terms, ROI tells you how efficient every dollar you spend is in generating profit for the company.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ROI = </strong>(Revenue - Investment cost) / Investment cost</p><p>Although the formula seems very simple, it's versatile and provides a basic idea of the profit/loss monthly. It also provides quantifiable results that let you measure the company's performance in different departments.</p><h3>#13. Monthly Recurring Revenue</h3><p>For subscription-based models like SaaS, banks, and telecommunication companies, monthly recurring revenue is one of the most important KPIs to monitor.&nbsp;</p><p>MRR is defined as the anticipated total revenue generated from all the active subscriptions in a month. That includes recurring charges from coupons, discounts, and add-ons.</p><p>Calculating MRR is quite simple and straightforward. You can do that by using the formula:</p><p><strong>MRR =</strong> Number of subscribers in a monthly plan X Average revenue per user</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have 5 subscribers on a $1000 monthly plan, then your MRR is $5000.</p><p>Tracking MRR helps you keep track of the monthly trends and provides valuable insights into the financial performance over time. It's also exceptionally useful in forecasting sales projections and planning for long and short-term business growth.</p><div><br></div><h2>How Many KPIs to Track?</h2><p>There is no magic number for how many KPIs you should be tracking. Instead of focusing on the number, you should make KPI reporting as transparent as possible. </p><p>Well, How do you make KPI reporting transparent and easy to understand?</p><p>You shouldn't be tracking everything.

These KPIs are essential to track so you know how efficiently your business's workforce is performing.</p><p>Here's an example to understand HR KPIs better:</p><p>AER Lab is an organization trying to increase its production this year. The BOD (Board of Directors) have decided to invest heavily in manufacturing and production units, but to do so, they need to cut costs on every other level, including HR.</p><p>Now, how will this goal be translated into HR KPIs?</p><p>For the Human Resource department, the cost-cutting can be in terms of reducing recruitment costs. Suppose we say AER Lab's current recruitment cost is $700,000, which must be under $500,000.&nbsp;</p><p>In this scenario, <strong>'Reduction in Recruitment Cost'</strong> is the KPI they should track and optimize.&nbsp;</p><p>Another excellent KPI for HR might be the <strong>‘Talent Turnover Ratio.’</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>A lower TTR results in fewer recruitment and training costs for new employees, contributing to the overall goal of reducing expenses.</p><p>So, AER Lab aims to reduce its TTR from 15% to 10% (which is good). Plus, the company has already decided to cut its recruitment costs by $200,000. Here's what their HR KPI template would look like:</p><img alt=""HR KPI examples"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wIpnOB4m6fnWuz7zLRgdD1Qobk.png""><p>Now that you know the basics of HR key performance indicators, let's see what KPIs for human resources to track for any business.</p><h2>What are the 13 Most Important Human Resources KPIs?</h2><h3>#1. Employee Retention</h3><p>Employee retention rate refers to the percentage of employees who stay with your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>It depends on how well a company can manage its workforce so that they are motivated and happy at what they do.</p><p>There could be several ways of doing that, like offering incentives and recognitions based on their performances. This encourages them to be more engaged and excel at their work.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Employees are the powerhouse of your organization. They are the ones who bring in more and more business. Without them, all you want to achieve as a company or as a group means nothing.</p><p>That's why it's important to measure this KPI so you can adopt effective retention strategies to achieve your business goals.</p><p>Not only does it result in higher productivity levels among your employees, but it also improves the all-around work culture of your company.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's how you can calculate it:</p><img alt=""employee retention rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0hunkQmY84Kbj9FPf1n9VNHOjjk.png""><h3>#2. Time to Fill</h3><p>Time to fill is the number of days it takes between the job requisition and the day a new hire accepts that position. It's one of the critical recruiting metrics that track the efficiency of the external hiring process.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Considering the talent shortage in the competitive labor market, it's crucial for HR to know how quickly an open position gets filled. That's why the time to fill is of so much use, especially for hard-to-fill job roles.</p><p>Tracking this KPI serves as a forecasting variable for talent recruitment strategies. In addition, it also helps HR to come up with more realistic plans so that they can handle situations like layoffs in a better way.</p><p>The time to fill varies for different industries based on the hiring process, job location, or the available talent in the market.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it can be expressed using a simple mathematical formula:</p><img alt=""time to fill formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/vbih8sbhmOLWIqr88HFn1X5vdA8.png""><h3>#3. Cost Per Hire</h3><p>Tracking cost per hire KPI lets you know the total resources you've put in to hire an employee.</p><p>These resources might be the money you spend on job post creation and its advertisement on Job boards, the time that goes into the hiring process, and the money you spend on referrals (in case any) when hiring a candidate.</p><p><a href=""https://ideal.com/cost-per-hire/"">According to Ideal</a>, the cost per hire should be 16% of the salary when the salary is less than $30,000 and 20% when it's more than $75,000.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><h5>#1. Knowing Recruitment and HR budget</h5><p>Tracking cost per hire clarifies the amount of money you require to hire in the next quarter or month. If you track this KPI annually, you know how much more or less you spent on hiring compared to the previous year and whether it’s a good or a bad thing.</p><h5>#2. Managing Costs</h5><p>The cost per hire need not always be low. Maybe your business is doing great, and you need to hire double the number of employees that you did in the previous quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from this, hard-to-fill roles (senior leadership roles) will always have a higher cost to hire.&nbsp;</p><p>Tracking this KPI will allow you to know where you need more funds and for which hiring position your business is overspending.</p><h5>#3. Measure Recruiters' Performance</h5><p>Measuring cost per hire KPI for HR will also give you a clear idea of the recruiters' efficiency. You want your employees to perform the best they can with minimal funds. So track this KPI and talk to your recruiters about where they can improve and where they can have more flexibility when hiring a candidate.</p><p>Measuring cost per hire is easy. Here's how to do it:</p><img alt=""cost per hire formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/liCsKuC0NVJPf1RLIWtHYfovROU.png""><h3>#4. Overtime Hours</h3><p>Overtime hours is a tricky HR KPI to track. Different values of this KPI tell you a whole different story.</p><p>An increase in the value of overtime hours might indicate:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>A sudden spike in workload, meaning more business</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Poor management leads to employees working after hours</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>An increase in the absent rate made employees take more work and do overtime</p></li></ul><p>At the same time, a lower value of overtime hours might indicate a streamlined business plan.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Tracking overtime hours for every employee individually lets you know the employee's dedication to your business. Such statistics could come in handy during promotion and increment cycles.</p><p>Whereas, if you track the overall overtime hours as a whole, the increase and decrease will let you know about the business performance. High overtime hours will, in most cases, mean a high demand for your business.</p><p>There's no formula for calculating overtime hours, but you can surely calculate the overtime pay using the formula below:</p><img alt=""overtime hours formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/GfwSc2Jcj3XRnKZMZyo4X2eyJQ.png""><h3>#5. Employee Productivity Rate</h3><p>Employee productivity rate helps you gauge your workforce effectiveness against your business objectives. With the help of this KPI, HRs can track three essential factors relating to employees:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Efficiency</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Satisfaction</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Engagement</p></li></ul><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>In general, employees are divided into productive and procrastinators.</p><p>Measuring the EPR allows you to better understand who's doing their job and who isn't. Besides this, understanding your employee productivity gives you a deeper understanding of your workforce's level of happiness, engagement, and belief in your company's mission.</p><p>A lower employee productivity rate indicates that your existing work environment is not conducive to employee expectations. Moreover, this KPI for HR can also highlight significant cultural or corporate problems going on in your organization.</p><p>To measure EPR (as an average), divide a company's total revenue for a specific period by the total number of employees.</p><img alt=""employee productivity rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/4MFFZqJTshP5NXqqrlovcmDQEVU.png""><p>However, this is a basic formula for calculating EPR; you can consider other factors such as employee satisfaction and engagement to get more accurate results.</p><p>Few important things to remember before you measure this HR KPI:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Decreasing productivity might be the result of poor work culture, lower pay scale, or overworking</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>To measure accurately, get an idea of how much time in a week is actually productive time (deduct the breaks, obviously)</p></li></ul><h3>#6. Training Costs</h3><p>Training cost refers to the expenses or costs incurred on training employees. This includes both training for new employees and present employees.</p><p>The 2020 Training Industry report shows that the <a href=""https://www.bizlibrary.com/blog/training-programs/cost-of-training-employees/"">average training cost</a> is close to $1,678 per employee.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Training costs are a crucial KPI to measure because it impacts your financial goals and workplace culture. A high training cost might shake your budget, while less-productive training programs may hamper employee productivity as a whole.</p><p>So it's all-important to draw a fine line between training costs and budget.</p><p>Here's a pretty simple formula to calculate training costs:</p><img alt=""training costs formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wg1UmKjm0rNE6Nj0vu3j64zI.png""><p>For example, let's say your training for the year costs $100,000, and you have 100 employees.</p><p><strong>Training cost per employee =</strong> $100,000 / 100 = $1,000</p><p>You can use this HR KPI to plan your training budgets yearly. However, there are a few factors that influence your training cost:</p><h5>#1. Business Size</h5><p>Organizations with a large employee base might seem to spend more on training; however, the case is otherwise.</p><p>Small organizations usually spend more on training than some of the large corporations out there.</p><p>This is because large corporations have a vast employee base, and it's affordable to divide a large amount into 1000s of small chunks compared to a small business with fewer employees.</p><p>Therefore, the size of your business has a direct influence on your training costs.</p><h5>#2. Industry Type</h5><p>The Training cost per employee differs from industry to industry. For example, an IT company may spend money polishing employees with essential IT tips and hacks to do work efficiently.</p><p>However, a manufacturing company will teach its employees about the machines used in the production line and keep them updated with new machine upgrades via regular training.&nbsp;</p><h3>#7. Recruiting Conversion Rate</h3><p>Recruiting conversion rate measures the ratio of the total number of applicants that are actually hired at the end of the recruitment drive.</p><p>Although there's no set benchmark for an effective recruitment process, this HR KPI will help you compare different recruitment processes you have used to date and figure out the most innovative method for future drives.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This HR KPI aims to find the source that gives you the best candidate at the lowest cost. Most organizations use recruiting conversion rate as a metric to gauge their internal recruitment strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>To calculate the RCR, divide the total number of successful hires by the number of vacancies in the company, and to find the percentage, multiply the result by 100. Here's how you can do it with a simple formula:</p><img alt=""recruiting conversion rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0A5wC7Te8n670tSFqE5KGRcNbbM.png""><p><strong>Tip:</strong> If your business suffers from a lower conversion rate, you are not getting a great return on investment.&nbsp;</p><h3>#8. Dismissal Rate</h3><p>The dismissal rate is the rate at which the employer terminates employees over a period.&nbsp;</p><p>Although this seems to be a casual metric that's easy to track, the dismissal rate is influenced by a series of factors, such as the expiration of employee contracts, resignations, layoffs, and retirement.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Voluntary terminations do not have a direct impact on the company. However, involuntary terminations such as layoffs or forced resignations due to poor performance cost the company a lot of time and money to replace that employee.</p><p>Hence, HRs need to identify the rate at which employees willingly or unwillingly exit from the organization. A low dismissal rate showcases a positive recruitment strategy and work culture.</p><p>Actually, calculating the dismissal rate is pretty simple:</p><img alt=""dismissal rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/UGp2yKep0kQxz1KE2N5uvW7170.png""><p>For example, a company hired 100 employees in Q1 of 2019, from which 25 exited the organization (some left willingly while others were dismissed due to inability to work).</p><p><strong>Dismissal Rate = </strong>(25 / 100) x 100 = 25%</p><p>Therefore, the company's dismissal rate stands at 25% for 2019.</p><h3>#9. Average Time Stay</h3><p>Average time stay is an important indicator of the attrition of your business. The longer an employee stays, the higher the ROI on hiring and training per employee.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Since you already know how much time and money it costs to hire and train new employees, you don't want to do the process frequently.</p><p>Besides measuring the employee journey in the organization, this metric gives valuable insights into employee retention and satisfaction.</p><p>And if used alongside other KPIs for HR such as employee turnover rate, average time stay can provide some magical insights.</p><img alt=""average time stayformula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/z08RYuD5BEP6U7fmqHTlALN7Hto.png""><p>Average time stay, however, is not a SMART KPI. But if you look at the benefits of measuring it against your HR strategies, the duration of your employee's tenure tells a whole story about your organization.</p><h3>#10. Talent Turnover Rate</h3><p>Talent turnover rate is defined as the percentage of employees who leave an organization during a period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>In the wake of the great resignation, the talent turnover rate for organizations has touched the sky. Some reports suggest that the talent turnover rates have been <a href=""https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/04-28-2022-gartner-says-us-total-annual-employee-turnover-will-likely-jump-by-nearly-twenty-percent-from-the-prepandemic-annual-average"">20% higher post-pandemic</a>.</p><p>While a turnover rate below 10% is considered reasonable by HRs, a higher turnover marks a negative impression on company culture and usually leads to a less motivated and productive workforce.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate the annual turnover ratio:</p><img alt=""talent turnover rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/LPDfumKjnHcY6Vc6CjKDu2zzQ4c.png""><p>Here,</p><p>L is the no. of employees who left the company over a period</p><p>B is the no. of employees at the beginning of the period</p><p>E refers to the no. of employees at the end of the period</p><h3>#11. Gender Diversity</h3><p>This is a general purpose term used to measure the distribution of gender across employees or particular institutions. Diversity often insists on maintaining a balance of growth opportunities, equal pay, and equal benefits for both men and women alike.&nbsp;</p><h4>Why Is It important</h4><p>Gender diversity has become an essential and pivotal element in today's corporate structure. Gender-related biases and inclinations often get called out publicly across businesses and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Gender diversity impedes a fair workplace with opportunities and disadvantages equal for all. It plays a significant role in attracting modern talent to build a healthy and collaboratively competitive workplace.</p><p>To calculate the percentage of each gender separately, use this formula:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/X68rc5PlFpek2qtsrKVLFZyaE.png""><h3>#12. Salary Competitiveness Ratio</h3><p>A salary competitiveness ratio measures how well you are compensated for your official profile/designation against industry benchmarks and peer coworkers.</p><p>Here's how to calculate SCR for two cases:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Salary Competitiveness Ratio (competitor) = Salary offered by your company / Salary offered by your competitor</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Salary Competitiveness Ratio (industry) = Salary offered by your company / Average Salary offered in the industry or sector</p></li></ul><p>The calculation stays pretty simple and allows you to assess and make more informed negotiations/</p><h3>#13.

Let's quickly get through some of the significant disadvantages of using Klipfolio.</p><h3>Reason #1. Technical Jargon Required</h3><p>Unlike other BI and KPI tracking software like Datapad and DashThis, Klipfolio has a higher learning curve. You might think, why?</p><p>Klipfolio comes with a suite of advanced features. As some of its users reported, these features are hard to understand, let alone used for non-technical members of their team.</p><p>No matter how easy-to-use Klipfolio is, you might interact with technical know-how or coding stuff at certain stages. Plus, the software in itself is a bit complicated, and users need to spend time on it to become experts.</p><p>Developers enjoy these technicalities, but non-technical guys suffer. And how many tech people have you known whose daily task is to track KPIs?</p><p>For example, we came across a few reviews where users faced trouble framing the backend of their dashboard. The technicalities were beyond their control until they hired a developer for the same.</p><img alt=""G2 Klipfolio negative review"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/CkAWvBkmYImqWjeSHwYlXg5KM.png""><p>Moreover, the syntax for formulas and names of functions varies a bit from excel or google sheets. Taking you a while to equate and customize formulas.</p><p>Evidently, the technicalities involved with Klipfolio makes it a try-fail-learn software.</p><p>So, why use a trial-and-error process when you can enjoy error-free analytics with Klipfolio's alternatives?</p><h3>Reason #2. Overwhelming Limitations</h3><p>Klipfolio struggles with minor and major limitations in its software. Although the software is regularly updated, the limitations are not yet considered.</p><p>Let's get through a few of its limitations that frustrate users.</p><p>Firstly, Klipfolio has API connectors, but their functionality is limited; it has no database to pipe in data from multiple sources. Meaning, you can't pull all the business data from some platforms (none of the connectors let you pull 100% data off).</p><img alt=""G2 Klipfolio Negative review - 2"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/NwdUBHieYCEV6qcPVI2peFjOGt0.png""><p>Secondly, Klipfolio has certain .csv file size limitations that become challenging for users to stick through.</p><p>It also has some design limitations that make it hard to adjust complex KPIs under one unified dashboard.</p><p>And lastly, dashboards do not refresh on their own. Although this should be among the free features, with Klipfolio, you need to pay the price to enjoy automatic updates.</p><h3>Reason #3. Poor Loading Time</h3><p>Suppose you paid for a software to speed up your work and are suddenly encountering poor loading time. We understand that feeling, so we're bound to share some better alternatives with you.</p><p>With Klipfolio, business dashboards and reports can sometimes take a while to load. Moreover, Some of the easier tasks take a little longer than you thought.</p><p>This slow-down might be due to complex KPIs and multiple databases. But, on the second note, why would you be looking for software to perform the complex tasks for you if it were that simple?</p><img alt=""G2 Klipfolio negative review - 3"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oept3reAgTqap17UQIjRXLaZPc.png""><p>Now that you know why you might need a Klipfolio alternative, it’s time to explore your options.</p><div><br></div><h2>11 Best Klipfolio Alternatives to Try this Year</h2><h2>#1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> helps you track all essential <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">metrics </a>from stunning dashboards.</p><p>The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use.

We'll also drill down the drawbacks of Excel for dashboard creation and explore its next-best alternative.</p><p>So let’s take it from the top!</p><h2>What Is a KPI Dashboard in Excel?&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Excel KPI dashboard</strong> is where metrics and KPIs are stored and visualized under a spreadsheet. Dashboards are used to keep crucial data under one hub for easy tracking</p><p>Dashboards created in Excel are single page (mostly, but not always). They help you track your business progress via in-built charts, tables, and views that are backed by data.</p><img alt=""excel kpi dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FLxdLdnN66V4UkQS3pvYuPCyoN0.png""><p>But creating a KPI dashboard in Excel comes with unwanted challenges and requires a steady eye for long hours. However, we've tried to drill down the dashboard creation process in five simple steps.</p><h2>How to Create a KPI Dashboard in Excel - Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Creating interactive dashboards in Excel can be tiring, and there are a few steps to take before finally stepping up on the boat.</p><p>Here’s a tutorial on how to do it:</p><img alt=""import data to excel"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/xFPCrRck95NG41B58vTwxKNyJss.gif""><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Use conditional formatting to improve readability of raw data.</p><h3>Step 3: Start With Data Cleansing and Filtering</h3><p>The data you imported in the previous step is called raw data. For creating a reliable dashboard, raw data is something you would hate to put in.</p><p>Fortunately, Excel comes with tools to ease your data cleansing process. For example, we have manually put a data set representing monthly sales.</p><img alt=""excel data filtering"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BrO4IXRDdfvFZVdoHfg3o6sTBc.png""><p>To polish data, Excel can help you with:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Align your data in ascending or descending order</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Custom Sorting:</strong> Sort data by column, value, color, font color, and order</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Data Filtering: </strong>Add an advanced filtering widget to each column</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Remove Duplicates</strong>: Removes any duplicate data</p></li></ul><h3>Step 4: Visualize Your Data</h3><p>Now that we've factual data with us. Let's get started with the next big step, which is - data visualizations.</p><p>For this, simply select the cells you want to add in the graph and click on <strong>Insert</strong> to present your data via charts and diagrams.</p><img alt=""excel chart creation"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/A6a0VUnAGMjJDyOM3bVIyhSzAYc.gif""><p>Excel gives you multiple chart choices to select from; bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs, and other visualizations. While assigning charts for your data, keep these things in mind:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Use combination charts to compare values and draw meaningful insights</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Use dynamic charts if you want to make selections and want the chart to update with it</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Use sparklines when you want to show a trend over time and, at the same time, save space on your dashboard</p></li></ul><p>Next, easily customize the chart/axes titles, data labels, colors, and data table via the chart formatting option.</p><img alt=""excel chart formatting"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/YsLErVUCpQtOnTi3p2JMaNq3qsM.png""><p>Once you’re done with the customization, it's time to prepare a full-fledged dashboard.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>You can also use pivot tables in your dashboard if you need them.</p><h3>Step 5: Create a Full Fledged Dashboard</h3><p>Although you have already worked on visualizing your data, keeping raw data and visuals on the same sheet can be confusing.</p><p>Do you remember we mentioned how to create a sub sheet in Excel? 🤔</p><p>In the same way, create another sub sheet in the same workbook and name it something as ""<strong>KPI Dashboard</strong>.""&nbsp;</p><p>You can copy and paste all the graphs on the new sub sheet and track them there.&nbsp;</p><img alt=""excel dashboards"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/z6cOaO9W2GNhwg0WLG0gaQdWE8.png""><p><strong>Note:</strong> Copy-pasting charts from one sub sheet to another is a manual process, which will take time. If you want to track KPIs via excel, there’s no way around it.</p><p>You and your team can use this sheet as a major KPI dashboard. Doing this helps you in three ways:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You get a whole screen for displaying multiple data visualizations</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You can choose who can access/view/edit the raw data sheet</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>If you make changes or edit the raw data, it will automatically be updated in the key performance indicator dashboard sheet&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>That's it, you have successfully created your first KPI dashboard in Excel.</p><p>However, to ease your burden, we have curated a list of some free <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/excel-dashboard"">excel dashboard </a>templates.

Here're a few good reasons why people switch to Datapad from Excel.</p><h3>#1. No Mobile Access</h3><p>You can't access your dashboard from your mobile. Yes, you can definitely view your dashboard via the XLCubed mobile app, but the flexibility and responsiveness you enjoy in its web application aren't the same elsewhere.</p><h3>#2. Hard to Maintain</h3><p>Excel provides next to no automation. It requires manual effort to import and clean your data, which sometimes might take hours. Plus, manual work increases the possibility of human errors.</p><p>In fact, there’s no space for human error because you might just compromise your dashboard's integrity even if you unintentionally fudge a number.</p><p>So when your company grows, so does your data, and with a lot of manual data cleaning and validation work, it might not be feasible to use Excel to track KPIs via dashboards.</p><h3>#3. No Real-time Access to Data</h3><p>Excel limits you from accessing your data in real-time. It doesn't update your data automatically, even if it's linked to a data source. Hence, the data you view in the Excel workbook is always outdated.</p><p>Again, automation is something that you'll miss if you choose to create a KPI dashboard on Excel.&nbsp;</p><h3>#4. Lacks in Terms of Collaboration</h3><p>A collaborative KPI dashboard is always better than just a Dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>What's the difference?</p><p>Although a KPI dashboard lets you present data via stunning visualizations, a collaborative dashboard allows you and your team to analyze, monitor, and share feedback simultaneously.</p><p>Let's be honest here. You're not near to success if you think of your business as a one-man show. Therefore, keeping your team aligned with the company goals and performance in real-time becomes really important.</p><h3>#5. Higher-Learning Curve</h3><p>Excel is a vast ocean that's tough to be explored in a day. Even with customizations, its chart wizard is pretty complicated for new users.&nbsp;</p><p>You may encounter formatting limitations and end up spending hours customizing charts.</p><p>For the most part, customizations in Excel are far away from just drag-and-drop.</p><h2>Keeping Track of Your KPIs from Excel is Time-Consuming: Here’s How You Can Do it Better for Free with Datapad</h2><p>Until now, it's crystal clear why most people prefer using KPI dashboarding software instead of creating a dashboard on Excel.</p><p>Hence, we've built a dashboarding tool that puts an end to your manual efforts.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eyY2EqHqnnwehgO83zVOJie4M2A.png""><p>Datapad is designed to make data analysis easier, especially for those using Google Sheets.

Software Onboarding and Ease of Use</h3><p>Onboarding plays a crucial role in any KPI dashboard software. As a user, you must look for dashboard software that has product demos and guides that explain why and how to use the platform. Apart from this, the software should be easy to use.</p><p>The software should be intuitive and user-friendly so that users can quickly and easily understand and interact with the dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>The software should have a simple and clear user interface that makes it easy to navigate and understand the dashboard's data. Another important thing a KPI dashboard software must offer is customization options. Customization helps users tailor the dashboard to meet their specific needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the dashboard should be able to display data in an organized manner, allowing for quick and easy identification of important data points.</p><h3>#2. Integration Capabilities with Other Tools</h3><p>Integration capabilities are important for KPI dashboard software because they allow it to connect with and pull data from other sources and systems.&nbsp;</p><p>This is important because a KPI dashboard is often used to track and monitor various metrics and indicators that are relevant to the business, and these metrics and indicators may come from a variety of different sources.</p><p>For example, a KPI dashboard might track sales data from a customer relationship management (CRM) system, financial data from an accounting software, and employee productivity data from a project management tool.&nbsp;</p><p>By integrating with these different systems, the KPI dashboard can automatically pull in data from these sources and display it in a single, unified view, making it easier for users to see and understand the data.</p><h3>#3. Dashboarding and Reporting Capabilities&nbsp;</h3><p>As a dashboard software, the primary goal of the tool is to create dashboards and help you track KPIs.&nbsp;</p><p>But when selecting a software, ensure that it has enough templates for you to select the dashboard type (marketing, sales, operations, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing that’s good to have in a dashboard software is the capability of converting these KPI dashboards into reports that you can share with your team.&nbsp;</p><h3>#4. Team Collaboration and Onboarding</h3><p>Another feature to look for when selecting a KPI dashboard software is the tool's ability to bring teams onboard. When your business grows, so does your team.&nbsp;</p><p>And when your team grows, you have the ability to track multiple KPIs for multiple teams (sales, marketing, production, manufacturing, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>So choose a software that lets you bring your team onboard in minutes, assign them dashboards or specific KPIs, and let them handle and track them as per their expertise.</p><h2>#1. <a href=""http://datapad.io"">Datapad</a></h2><p>Ever wondered how easy your life would become if you can track KPIs from mobile phones?

But yet, there are ample amounts of KPIs that cater to every business need.&nbsp;</p><p>No wonder they are so common for small businesses, mid-sized companies, or large enterprises.</p><p>So here in this article, we will walk you through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and their importance. We'll also tell you how you can escape the mirage of vanity metrics and discover the best 30 KPIs that your teams can track in 2022 and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>But first, let’s answer a more basic question…</p><h2>What Is a KPI?&nbsp;</h2><p>Key Performance Indicators, popularly termed KPIs, are quantifiable measurements used by businesses to gauge their overall performance.&nbsp;</p><p>A KPI adds a numeric value to anything you measure – company finances, operations, growth, customer experience, and employee productivity.</p><p>Here’s one example of how you can leverage KPIs:</p><p>Suppose you're a lead generation company, you can set specific KPIs that act as small targets for your employees to achieve during a period. These KPIs can later be used for three significant purposes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>To measure progress and streamline processes</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>To evaluate the performance of employees</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>To demonstrate your achievement to clients&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Why are KPIs important?</h2><p>From measuring performance to presenting data in an easy-to-understand format, KPIs do it all. Here are the three reasons every business nowadays tracks KPIs.</p><h3>Reason #1. Comparing Performance and Measuring Progress</h3><p>With the help of KPIs, you can quickly pivot to both phases of your business, which are:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How well are you doing as compared to your past performance?&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What does your performance in the coming years look like?</p></li></ul><p>Since you have the historical data of your performance, you can always compare them to measure improvements. Meanwhile, you can gauge your progress toward set goals and business objectives in real time.</p><h3>Reason #2. Boost Employee Morale</h3><p>KPIs are not limited to outlining the company's performance. Instead, they have roots deeper into your organization.</p><p>They help you set goals for your team. While your team is aware of why they are doing what they are doing; they are more productive and determined to achieve the set business goals.</p><p>This keeps your team intact and motivated in the long run.</p><h3>Reason #3. Make Better Data-Driven Decisions</h3><p>Key performance indicators provide real-time snapshots of your business’s performance. Since you're part of a highly competitive market, measuring your growth and strategies would be vital to 'beat' the competition.</p><p>Besides, insights generated from tracking KPIs are highly accurate (if measured perfectly) and can be used to forecast future revenue and iterate strategies.</p><p>Now that you know the basics of KPIs, it’s time to understand vanity metrics.</p><h2>What KPIs Are Considered Vanity Metrics?</h2><p><em>""One rotten apple can spoil all the remaining ones in the fruit basket.""</em></p><p>This fits best when talking about KPIs' relationship with vanity metrics. You see, vanity metrics are data that seem impressive at a glance but don't really provide actionable insights to boost business productivity or ROI.</p><p>For example, consider a website's landing page for an eBook download. Measuring the number of page views is a metric, but it doesn't qualify or help you make any specific decisions.</p><p>On the other hand, measuring the weekly or monthly download rate might help you set goals or test different tactics for improving it.&nbsp;</p><p>In context with the above example, there are a ton of vanity metrics, such as the number of likes, shares, views, unique visitors, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>So should you stay completely away from vanity metrics?</p><p>The answer is both no and yes.</p><p>If you're just a small business, you should stay away from vanity metrics and focus on more specific KPIs.</p><p>For example, instead of tracking the traffic on your website, track the number of signups or the number of people who are taking a free trial of your app/software.</p><p>You can track vanity metrics when you are a significantly big organization and are already tracking specific KPIs. Tracking vanity metrics at that point makes complete sense.</p><p>To avoid vanity metrics, ask the questions when setting KPIs:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What business decision can we make with the metric?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What can we do to reproduce the results intentionally?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Is the data a real reflection of the truth?</p></li></ul><p>Or even better, a tried-and-tested way to escape the vanity metric pitfall is by <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/smart-kpis"">keeping your KPIs SMART</a> - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.</p><h3>Examples of Vanity Metrics (And What to Track Instead)</h3><img alt=""which metrics are likely to be vanity metrics"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/jj1nwtWzF0EzF5iN2cVi97udlc.png""><h2>30 Common KPI Examples for Every Vertical</h2><p>A business has so many verticals; tracking KPIs for every vertical is tough. But you can’t just ignore it because it's tough, right?</p><p>So here are the 30 best KPIs you should track for verticals like business, sales, marketing, operation, CX, and finance.</p><h2>Business KPI Examples</h2><img alt=""business kpi dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/NF3k1ylyK883ZT5jJDZlrqaSS8.png""><h3>#1. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)</h3><p>The average revenue per user calculates the amount of revenue you're generating from every active customer. Although Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is a great metric to track, ARPU kicks things up a notch and lets you dive deeper into your user's persona.</p><p><em>ARPU = Monthly recurring revenue / Number of active customers</em></p><p>Where,</p><p>MRR = Number of customers X Average billed amount</p><h3>#2. Monthly Active Users</h3><p>This KPI calculates the number of customers actively using your product during the said month.</p><p>This can help you calculate your MRR, ARPU, and performance of marketing campaigns.</p><p>While an increase in MAU is excellent, a sudden decrease in MAU can be due to several factors, such as technical issues, price hikes, or lack of reactivation campaigns.</p><h3>#3. Monthly Sales Growth</h3><p>As the name suggests, monthly sales growth lets you compare your sales month-over-month. It also lets you find leakages on the spot and work on improvements without awaiting the annual sales results.</p><p><em>Monthly sales growth = {(Sales for the current month - Sales for the prior month) / Sales for the prior month} x 100</em></p><h3>#4. Customer Lifetime Value</h3><p>Customer lifetime value refers to the revenue generated from a customer during his relationship with the business.</p><p><em>CLV = (TM x OV x GM x LT) / Total number of customers for the period</em></p><p>Where,</p><p>TM refers to the average transactions per month</p><p>OV is the average order value</p><p>GM stands for average gross margin</p><p>And LT is the average customer lifetime in months&nbsp;</p><h3>#5. Customer Churn Rate</h3><p>The churn rate refers to the percentage at which customers stop making purchases from you over a given period of time. It's a vital metric for SaaS or subscription-based companies.</p><p><em>Churn Rate = (Lost Customers / Total number of customers at the start of the period) X 100</em></p><p>Where,</p><p>Lost customers equal the total customers at the start of the period minus the total customers at the end.</p><h2>Sales KPI Examples</h2><img alt=""sales kpi dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/JZixDmuVJen01OAL2tan2jFbQoU.png""><h3>#6. Sale Cycle Length</h3><p>This KPI measures the time taken from initial interaction with the prospect to closing the sale.&nbsp;</p><p>Sales managers can use this metric to evaluate sales rep performance, i.e., who closes deals quickly while who needs improvements.</p><p>Secondly, you can set specific benchmarks using these insights and work on optimizing the process and making it more efficient.</p><p><em>Average sales cycle length = Total number of days to close all sales / Total number of new deals</em></p><h3>#7. Sales Opportunities</h3><p>This metric calculates the estimated sales value of a lead, based on the probability of closing the deal.</p><p>To measure this KPI, you need to assign an opportunity value to every stage of the sales journey, namely:&nbsp;</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Proposal (0.2)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Qualified (0.5) and&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Negotiation (0.8)</p></li></ul><p><em>Sales Opportunity = Sales Value X Opportunity value</em></p><h3>#8. Quota Attainment</h3><p>Quota attainment measures the proportion of deals (either numbers or revenue) a sales rep has closed with respect to the set target for a given period.</p><p><em>Quota attainment = Number of closed deals or revenue in a given time period / Quota for that time period</em></p><h3>#9. Average Purchase Value</h3><p>As the name suggests, this KPI measures the average amount a customer spends on your product or services. An excellent way to improve average purchase value is to strengthen upsell or cross-sell opportunities.</p><p><em>Average purchase value = Total sales / Number of transactions</em></p><h3>#10. Lead-to-Win Ratio</h3><p>The lead-to-win ratio, or lead conversion ratio, calculates how many of the total prospects or qualified leads convert into actual sales.</p><p>The KPI helps sales managers understand crucial things, such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Product-market fit</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Pricing structure</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Convincing power of sales reps</p></li></ul><p>And much more.</p><p>You can determine which sales practices provide results and which seek improvisations.</p><p><em>Lead-to-win ratio = Total number of sales / Total number of leads</em></p><h2>Marketing KPI Examples</h2><img alt=""marketing kpi dashboard "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/A3buV54qXTCdNZwbAzCssxnsE.png""><h3>#11. Customer Acquisition Cost</h3><p>Customer acquisition cost, or CAC, refers to the total cost incurred on acquiring a new customer. This includes the cost of advertising, technology, remunerations, and overheads.</p><p>If CAC &gt; CLV, the business might soon run out of funds as the cost of acquiring customers is more than what they spend on your business.</p><p><em>CAC = Total money spent on marketing / Number of customers acquired</em></p><h3>#12. Marketing ROI</h3><p>Return on Investment in marketing refers to the amount of money gained from the overall marketing cost incurred.</p><p><em>Marketing ROI = (Sales revenue - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost</em></p><p>Calculating your marketing ROI determines how effective your marketing activities and campaigns are running.&nbsp;</p><p>An ROI of 5:1 is considered good, while a ratio of 10:1 is excellent. However, anything below 2:1 is considered non-profitable.</p><h3>#13. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)</h3><p>Typically measured to determine the success of your ad campaigns, ROAS defines the revenue generated for each dollar spent on advertisements.</p><p>A standard ROAS benchmark is the 4:1 ratio - $4 in revenue to $1 in ad spend.</p><p><em>ROAS = Total revenue generated from ad campaigns / Total money spent on ads</em></p><h3>#14. Bounce Rate</h3><p>Bounce rate measures the percentage of visitors that leave a web page or landing page without taking action. Generally, this occurs due to the following:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Slow page loading speed</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Unattractive page design</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Poorly drafted content</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Visitor-by-mistake</p></li></ul><p><em>Bounce Rate = Single-page sessions / Total sessions</em></p><h3>#15. Landing Page Conversion Rate</h3><p>This KPI is like the traffic-to-lead ratio. It measures the number of visitors that took action on a specific landing page to the total number of visitors the page received.</p><p>Insights derived from this KPI can be used to perform A/B testing on landing pages and improve text, design, or CTAs to generate higher conversions.</p><p><em>Landing Page Conversion Rate = (Number of conversions during a period / Total visitors during the same period) X 100</em></p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/marketing-kpis""><strong> 11 Marketing KPIS every Marketing Team Should Track</strong></a></p><h2>Operations KPI Examples</h2><img alt=""operational kpi dashboard"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/TStvBGsFYjtTk9pJanmKtqLjK4.png""><h3>#16. Working Capital</h3><p>Working capital refers to the available capital of the business that can be used for day-to-day operations. It's calculated by subtracting the current assets from the current liabilities.</p><p><em>Working Capital = Current assets - Current liabilities</em></p><h3>#17. Order Fulfillment Cycle Time</h3><p>This KPI measures the time it takes from receiving an order to getting it delivered to the customer. It provides insights into the inbound team's efficiency in processing the order and the effectiveness of your supply chain to manufacture, pack, and deliver it.</p><p><em>Order Fulfillment Cycle Time = Source Cycle Time + Production Cycle Time + Delivery Cycle Time</em></p><h3>#18. Cash Conversion Cycle</h3><p>The cash conversion cycle measures how long it takes for a company to convert its available inventory into cash. Basically, it measures how quickly you can sell your stock to gain back the money incurred to purchase it.&nbsp;</p><p>This KPI is comprised of three other KPIs:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Days Sale Outstanding (DSO)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)</p></li></ul><p><em>Cash Conversion Cycle = DIO + DSO - DPO</em></p><h3>#19. Machine Downtime Rate</h3><p>This KPI calculates the time an asset or equipment is not working. It can be due to planned (repair, servicing) or unplanned (malfunction) reasons. However, any downtime will affect your production, so this KPI is vital for operation managers.</p><p><em>Machine Downtime Rate = (Amount of time the equipment is down / Planned operating time) x 100</em></p><h3>#20. Employee Satisfaction Rate</h3><p>Employee satisfaction rate measures the percentage of happy and satisfied employees to the total employees in the organization.</p><p>Although there are several ways to measure ESR, the most popular way is by using eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score).</p><p>To do so, you need to share survey forms (having a scale from 0 to 10) with employees. Now we categorize the voters into three types:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Promoters (9 -10): </strong>Happy and satisfied employees</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Passives (7-8): </strong>Neither happy nor unhappy; neutral</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Detractors (0-6):</strong> Unhappy employees</p></li></ul><p>To calculate eNPS, use this formula:</p><p><em>eNPS = % of Promoters - % of Detractors</em></p><h2>Customer Experience KPI Examples</h2><img alt=""customer exprience kpi examples"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/UBPeSQzaeVAKHecuDYgxh18pUyk.png""><h3>#21. Customer Retention Rate (CRR)</h3><p>The customer retention rate measures the percentage of customers likely to make repeat purchases from your business over a given period.</p><p><em>Customer Retention Rate = {CE - CN) / CS} X 100</em></p><p>Where,</p><p>CE is the number of customers at the end of the period</p><p>CN equals the number of customers acquired during the period</p><p>CS is the number of customers at the beginning of the period</p><h3>#22. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)</h3><p>This is a simple yet important metric that helps you understand the satisfaction level of your customers and their expectations of your business.</p><p>To calculate this KPI, share a survey form with a scale from 0 to 10 and categorize voters as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Unhappy Customers: </strong>0-6&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Neutral Customers: </strong>7-8&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Happy Customers: </strong>9-10</p></li></ul><p>Now, calculate CSAT:</p><p><em>CSAT = Number of happy customers (people who responded with 9,10) / Total number of respondents</em></p><h3>#23. Average Resolution Time</h3><p>The average resolution time calculates the time it takes for a customer support executive to resolve a ticket. Although the resolution time also depends on the complexity of the problem, the lower, the better.</p><p><em>Average Resolution Time = Total resolution time for all tickets resolved / Total number of tickets resolved</em></p><h3>#24. Net Promoter Score</h3><p>The net promoter score is a popular metric used by professionals to measure what percentage of customers are willing to recommend your product to their network.</p><p>To calculate NPS you have to run a survey form containing one or few questions and a scale ranging from 0-10 among customers. Then, categorize voters based on: Promoters (9-10), Passive (7-8), and Detractors (0-6).</p><p>Promoters are the customers who are highly likely to recommend your product.</p><p><em>NPS = (% of promoters - % of detractors)</em></p><h3>#25. Customer Effort Score (CES)</h3><p>Customer Effort Score, or CES, measures how much effort a prospect requires to interact with your business. And are they really happy about it?</p><p>Like NPS, you can share survey forms with a scale from 0 to 7. Usually, if a customer gives you a score of 5,6, or 7, they are happy, and it takes less time for your business to reach out to their customers.</p><p><em>CES = ( Number of responses with 5,6,7 / no. of responses) X 100</em></p><h2>Financial KPI Examples</h2><img alt=""financial kpi examples"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/GHKToddfzy9UzSvmYqu631roI1Y.png""><h3>#26. Net Profit Margin</h3><p>Net profit margin is the ultimate metric of profitability. It measures the amount of profit a business makes after accounting for its expenses, including taxes.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) X 100</em></p><h3>#27. Gross Profit Margin</h3><p>Gross profit is the profit remaining with a company after deducting the cost of goods sold (labor and material cost) from the net sales.&nbsp;</p><p>This KPI makes it easy to measure profitability and compare performance with competitors.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gross Profit Margin = (Net sales – COGS) / Net sales x 100%</em></p><h3>#28. Inventory Turnover Rate</h3><p>The inventory or stock turnover rate measures the number of times your inventory is sold over during a particular time frame. It prevents you from any unwanted surprises, such as order cancellation due to the unavailability of stock. It also helps you optimize cash flow.</p><p><em>Inventory Turnover Rate = (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory) X 100</em></p><h3>#29. Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h3><p>The debt-to-equity ratio is a core financial metric that calculates the company's financial leverage by dividing its total debts and liabilities by its shareholder's equity.</p><p><em>DE = (Short term debts + Long term debts) + other payments / Shareholder’s equity</em></p><h3>#30. Accounts Receivable (AR) Turnover</h3><p>This KPI measures how efficiently the business collects debts and credits it extended a while back to its customers.</p><p><em>AR = Net credit sales / Average account receivable</em></p><h2>How to Build Beautiful Dashboards For Free with Datapad?</h2><p>With all the 30 KPIs ready to be tracked, all you need is a free and easy-to-use dashboarding tool.</p><img alt=""datapad kpi dashboard tool"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FqgdtKYBETKzMHVLxCXeKl4YlQ.png""><p>Datapad is a mobile-friendly KPI tracking and dashboarding tool that lets you collect, monitor, and present data via beautiful dashboards.&nbsp;</p><p>Our tool is entirely mobile-first (the desktop version is coming soon).&nbsp;</p><p>The best part about Datapad is that you need to have no coding experience to build dashboards.

If yes, KPI reports can be your solution as they can save your investors’ time and make them come to a conclusion quickly.</p><p>KPI reports are a compilation of all crucial KPIs that your company tracks. It could help inventors, team members, and business leaders make calculated decisions based on the same.</p><p>In this article, we will tell you the basics of KPI reports, their benefits, types, KPI examples that make up a report, and much more.</p><p>So let’s dive straight into the guide.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/EywT2iJO6QOR9dDyXavGLvJ7pdk.gif""><h2>What is a KPI Report?</h2><p>A KPI report is a performance measurement tool that allows you to track, measure, and analyze crucial business KPIs and gauge the overall business performance with respect to set goals.</p><p>A typical KPI report consists of several data visualization elements such as graphs, charts, tables, and more to present complex data in an easy-to-read format. However, as said, modern-day KPI reports are dynamic in nature and surface an interactive interface.&nbsp;</p><p>This means you can easily reorganize elements to display information in a way that is pleasant to the eyes. In addition, you can instantly access your report from anywhere around the world.</p><img alt=""kpi report"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0BbVTwTZq9y38lHw3yz06Tchs3w.png""><h2>What Are the Benefits of KPI Reports?</h2><img alt=""benefits of kpi reports"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/xFtd2u789PqGjsKyP5fVQFH78y0.png""><h3>Benefit #1. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses</h3><p>Not surprisingly, KPI reports are built to present data in an easy-to-understand format. This, in turn, helps managers and business owners easily identify trends over time.</p><p>They get a crystal-clear idea of what strategies or loopholes can make or break their business. Moreover, managers can use this information to grasp hidden opportunities within their business strategies.</p><p>In a similar way, with the help of KPI reports, leaders can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the organization based on factual, reliable data instead of guesswork.</p><p>For example, if the KPI reports show that a particular business strategy yields better results for the organization, leaders can repurpose or duplicate such strategies for multiple departments.</p><h3>Benefit #2. Bridge the Learning Gaps</h3><p>These reports (especially employee KPI reports) analyze employee performance over time. Thereby allowing you to better understand your workforce's capabilities and downsides.</p><p>Moreover, making KPI data available to employees can positively direct their behavior. You see, when they know what they are up to and what's expected from them, they tend to adjust their performance toward the measurement.</p><h3>Benefit #3. Incentivize Performance</h3><p>Data doesn't lie, and no matter how debatable a topic is, if it has data to prove itself, you can't simply disagree.&nbsp;</p><p>The same goes for in-house teams and departments. You can't blame someone for being less productive without proving it, and without knowing their efforts, you can't give them a selfless raise.</p><p>A KPI report demonstrates employees' performance towards set goals. Adding incentives to these KPIs is a proven way to improve employees performance, boost morale, and drive record-breaking results.</p><h2>KPI Reports vs. Metric Reports: What Are the Differences?</h2><p>Although they sound alike, KPI and metric reports are two completely different aspects of measuring your business performance.</p><p>A metric is made up of raw data, while a KPI is made up of several metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, metrics reports are used by companies to understand their KPIs, which in turn helps them discover if they're going to meet their goals within the set time frame or not.</p><p>Generally, professionals gather crucial business metrics into one comprehensive report, which different departments then use as a reference document to find information about organizational goals.</p><p>KPI reports, on the other hand, are laser-focused and tied to specific goals and objectives. Unlike metric reports, which provide a granular view of your business performance, KPI reports revolve around high-level metrics that directly impact your organizational goals.</p><img alt=""kpi reports ve metric reports"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/EHpXcvCfSHN3ghmhwvQvF7FZ8.png""><h2>Types of KPI Reports</h2><img alt=""4 types of kpi reports"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/cGPiyDxei3Xe8lsJlV9d81jLA.png""><p>KPI reports are categorized into four types, namely:</p><h3>Type #1.

Understand the Purpose of the Report</h3><p>Before getting started with report creation, make sure you're clear on one question: What's your intention behind creating the KPI report?</p><p>Every business, regardless of size or industry, has predetermined goals and objectives. And to understand which KPIs fit best with your business model, you must have a chat with key stakeholders and decision-makers to discuss your business aims, strategic goals, and objectives.</p><p>Whatever it is, ensure that your report comprises three things:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>A long-term goal</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Measurable results</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Achievable Milestones</p></li></ul><p>Doing this will lay down the foundation of your KPI report. In addition, you'll better understand where to aim your efforts and what metrics or KPIs can help you measure success toward your goals.</p><h3>Step #2.

As said earlier, decide on your goals and stick to them. Avoid adding new goals or improvising the set goals just to sound ambitious</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>❌ Don't add too much to your reports: </strong>It's easy to get overwhelmed by the number of data sources available. But you can leave out some KPIs that you feel are irrelevant. The best idea is to focus on a small number of KPIs that align with your business objectives.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>❌Don't choose a tool with a higher-learning curve: </strong>If you're using a reporting tool, make sure it's easy to use by you and your team. Some features like drag-and-drop customizations, no-code KPI reporting, and more allow anyone to track and monitor KPIs easily.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>❌ Don't leave your reports unchanged with time: </strong>Since the market is highly dynamic, you can't just create and forget about the KPI report. You must iterate or tweak your reporting KPIs or business strategies on a regular basis for accurate results and impactful decision-making.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>❌<strong>Don't do it alone:</strong> And lastly, don't try being a one-man army. The proudy it sounds, the lamer it is. Since KPI reports play a significant role in making strategies and decisions, they should always be made in a collaborative environment.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Creating KPI reports isn’t a tough job.

Our grandma used to narrate the story every once in a while.</p><p>In the business world, the rabbit is the likes of Amazon and Walmart, which offer one-day delivery, and the tortoise is those businesses that deliver a product in a week.</p><p>Unlike the OG story, <em><strong>‘Slow and steady doesn’t win the race’ </strong></em>in the business world.</p><p>With the E-commerce economy surging to <a href=""https://unctad.org/news/global-e-commerce-jumps-267-trillion-covid-19-boosts-online-sales"">$26.7 Trillion</a>, logistics are an important reason behind the success of e-commerce giants.</p><p><strong>Food for Thought:</strong> What’s the use of a one-click purchase with a delayed delivery or getting the wrong product?</p><p>To prevent such incidents, logistic KPIs come into play, kpis for logistics are defined to manage your logistic operations with ease and transparency.</p><p>In this article, we’ll drill down the fundamentals of logistic KPIs, how they are important, and the best KPIs every logistic manager should measure.</p><h2>What are KPIs in Logistics?</h2><p>When tracked, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) give you an idea of how your business performs against the set goals or industrial benchmarks.</p><p>Logistics holds a crucial place in driving business success because a proper logistics system will streamline delivery time.</p><p>Logistic KPIs ease the process of managing logistic departments within organizations. These KPIs quantify every possible process that goes into purchasing, warehousing, order fulfillment, and transporting them and present you with actionable data and insights.</p><h3>Benefits of Tracking Logistic KPIs</h3><p>Logistics managers use logistic KPIs to gauge processes against set industry benchmarks. These KPIs help managers remain updated with their daily production, cost, and quality rates.</p><p>Moreover, in the logistics area, these insights can help you consistently monitor and evaluate granular metrics related to your supply chain.</p><p>Let's see it the other way around. </p><p>One of the top goals of logistic managers is procuring adequate resources, testing and properly packing the goods, and transporting them to the right location and, of course, to the right person.</p><p>Now to perform so many tasks simultaneously, managers ought to get some help. </p><p>It's not uncommon among production lines and supply chain staff to call out a strike in case of disruption.</p><div><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/heyarnold-hey-arnold-nicksplat-3ohjVabojNBmsqeqg8"">via GIPHY</a></div><p><a href=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohjVabojNBmsqeqg8/giphy.gif"">Source</a></p><p>Measuring the right set of logistic KPIs lets you operate with fewer disruptions and higher productivity. </p><p>Now you might wonder, <em>‘What are the Logistics Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you should track to measure your logistic operations?’ </em></p><p>We got you covered.😉</p><h2>15 Best Logistic KPIs Every Logistic Manager Should Track</h2><h3>KPI #1. Operating Ratio</h3><p>The operating ratio is measured by comparing the total operating expenses of a company to net sales.</p><p>As said, this KPI shows the relationship between the amount of revenue earned and the total cost incurred in running the logistic operations.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Tell us one thing; If your expenses are more than your revenue, how are you planning to manage your finances?</p><p>In the same context, a lower operating cost indicates better higher profits. But cutting down your operating expenses on the cost of quality will result in blunders. </p><p>Instead, be creative in cost cutting, such as purchasing inventory in bulk, adopting automation wherever feasible, and more.</p><p>Typically, an operation ratio between 60-80% is considered as good. However, the lower, the better.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate the operating ratio:</p><img alt=""operation ratio formua"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ai2WCrrhN4zL43fOG2QZpp8zs.png""><p>For example, if your operating expenses account for $5000, and the total revenue is $15000</p><p>Your operating ratio equals $5000/$15000 = <strong>33.33%</strong></p><h3>KPI #2. Inventory Turnover Ratio</h3><p>Inventory turnover, preferably known as stock rotation, is a valuable logistic KPI.</p><p>It’s the measure of how fast your inventory is sold during a given period of time.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>By measuring inventory turnover, you identify what amount of stock you need to purchase to fulfill the demand. Tracking this KPI also lets you figure out the demand for certain products compared to others. </p><p>This can eventually help you purchase the right products in the right quantity. Plus, having a surplus stock of an in-demand product can skyrocket your sales.</p><p>To calculate the inventory turnover ratio or stock rotation, divide your total sales by the average inventory value.</p><img alt=""inventory ratio formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mSK0oX5He02ShQCoAOh3Ht64yk.png""><p>A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates a strong sales strategy and a high demand for goods you sell. </p><h3>KPI #3. Inventory Accuracy Rate</h3><p>What if you never know what's lying in your inventory? And what if a customer orders something that isn't in your stock but is displayed in your catalog?</p><p>That's where inventory accuracy comes in.</p><p>This KPI lets you measure the difference between your warehouse stock records and real-life inventory.</p><h4>What Is It Important?</h4><p>A sustainably higher difference between said, and real-life inventory can make or break your business.</p><p>We sound so harsh because an inaccurate inventory results in unexpected backorders and can show you surplus inventory in stock while you're down to your last unit.</p><p>That's what makes tracking inventory accuracy ratio so important.</p><p>Here's how you can measure inventory accuracy:</p><img alt=""inventory accuracy formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QgKxjaEK3chqP5miCAZ29GwXb3I.png""><h3>KPI #4. Capacity Utilization</h3><p>Capacity utilization measures the number of resources utilized vs. the total available resources. </p><p>This one is a comprehensive KPI. Using capacity utilization logistic KPI, you can measure the equipment utilization rate, the load capacity of a transport vehicle or container, and much more.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Although this KPI doesn't seem necessary, it has everything to do with logistics.</p><p>Unhealthy use of available resources can cost you a fortune if not directed in the right direction. </p><p>In the case of production, underutilizing your resources can hamper your supply chain. Moreover, lower capacity utilization is an omen of economic slowdown.</p><p>You can measure capacity utilization by dividing the actual output achieved by the maximum output that could have been achieved.</p><img alt=""capacity utilization formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/r42Px8AyEGNjsNl5jMMOUUtUHM.png""><p>When it comes to transportation, low-capacity utilization simply increases the transportation cost by hiring another container. It's a simple KPI that can be improved by figuring out new ways to increase container capacity.</p><h3>KPI #5. Pick and Pack Cycle Time</h3><p>Pick and pack cycle time refers to the average time it takes for an employee to pick a product from the shelf and pack it.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Every minute matters in logistics, and this KPI is important for logistics managers out there. Measuring this KPI on a monthly basis allows you to compare your warehouse employees' productivity over time. </p><p>Moreover, you can always work on improving this cycle time by enabling automation or increasing the number of employees in the packaging section. </p><p>However, try not to overload your employees with unachievable goals. It might get you to your goals but will also promote an unhealthy work culture in your company.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to measure cycle time:</p><img alt=""cycle time formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/H7kngD2ify35gDg62pX9bPzCHYU.png""><p>To visualize this KPI, logistic managers use comparison charts to individually gauge the performance of multiple product lines.</p><h3>KPI #6. Truck Turnaround Time</h3><p>Truck turnaround time, also known as Truck turning, is the logistic version of average dwell time.</p><p>It measures the time from when a delivery truck enters the warehouse to collect or deliver products to when it exits the facility.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Typically, this KPI measures a company's loading and unloading efficiency. It's a popular KPI among companies that offer road transportation.</p><p>Although the dwell time doesn't show an effect in real-time, it can cause major disruptions in the long term. And so, logistic managers try to keep a low truck turnaround time to ensure a smooth flow of operations.</p><img alt=""truck turnaround rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ru3iDXv6tH6357zepGLbbSTlk.png""><h3>KPI #7. Average Transportation Cost</h3><p>The average transportation cost is the average cost of transportation expenses compared to gross monthly income.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This KPI is preferably measured month over month. It will break down the cost incurred in order processing, administrative processes, inventory carrying, warehousing, and transportation.</p><p>This way, you get crystal-clear insights into the processes that cost you more. The goal is to decrease transportation costs while maintaining high-quality delivery operations.</p><p>Calculating this KPI is pretty straightforward. Simply divide the average transit cost by the monthly gross income.</p><img alt=""average transportation cost formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lacCvOuACFQw7qmL8mplEESNOjA.png""><p>Here, the average transit cost is the sum of all costs incurred from processing to transportation by the total number of goods transported.</p><h3>KPI #8. Freight Cost Per Unit Shipped</h3><p>As the name depicts, this is a simple logistic KPI. It measures the amount of $$$ spent on shipping a product over a period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This KPI is interrelated to the capacity utilization metric. </p><p>Do you know how?</p><p>Companies desire a lower freight cost, so they want their container fully loaded. Doing this not only saves the company huge money but also accounts for fuller utilization of resources.</p><p>Meanwhile, no one wants to overload the container just to cut down on freight. That's a blur practice in play.</p><p>Here's how you can measure freight cost per unit.</p><img alt=""freight cost per unit formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nWb6scXWZrUtJrNL07ZiyFGs20.png""><p>For example, if a company incurs $12,000 for shipping 6,000 units from point A to B. Their freight cost stands at $12,000 / 6000, i.e, <strong>$2/unit</strong>.</p><h3>KPI #9. Number of Shipment</h3><p>This KPI tracks the number of orders that are shipped out of the warehouse. The number of shipments is a pretty straightforward KPI and common among businesses.</p><h4>Why Is It important?</h4><p>This KPI evaluates the average number of shipments a company can handle over a period (weekly / monthly / yearly). </p><p>Any change in this trajectory indirectly impacts your revenue per sale and gross revenue over a period.</p><p>A higher number of shipments indicate positivity on all sides, that is, an increase in demand and your capacity to fulfill the orders. </p><p>By studying the insights from this KPI, logistics managers can figure out ways to improve the shipment capability of their supply line. </p><p>Besides, they could use this information to increase staffing and revenue accordingly.</p><h3>KPI #10. Use of Packaging Material</h3><p>Do you optimize your packing material usage? If not, you might miss out on <a href=""https://packmojo.com/blog/understanding-packaging-pricing-economies-of-scale/"">10 - 40%</a> of revenue per product.</p><p>The use of packaging material is a logistics metric that measures the amount of raw materials used for packaging each product in your pick &amp; pack process.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>On a lighter note, Amazon alone generated <a href=""https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22214017/online-shopping-pandemic-packaging-ecommerce-waste-plastic"">465 million</a> pounds of packaging waste. That amount of plastic waste is enough reasons to measure this KPI.</p><p>Besides, logistics managers should use sustainable, recyclable, and eco-friendly packing materials to lower logistics costs and reduce environmental impacts. </p><p>For example, recycled paper and plastic, reused cardboard, cellulose, compostable bags, sugarcane boards, and more.</p><h3>KPI #11. On-Time Pickup Percentage</h3><p>On-time pickup is a logistics KPI interlinked to the pick and pack cycle time.</p><p>It allows you to measure the number of items a freight carrier picked on time in full compared to the total number of shipped items.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Typically, pick-up is the foremost step in the logistics process. And if the first step itself is delayed, the whole operation suffers a halt. Hence, logistic managers are keen on measuring the on-time pickup percentage.</p><p>From a broader perspective, this KPI shows how efficient your carrier services are in terms of punctuality. </p><p>Moreover, a higher on-time pick-up percentage indicates scheduled delivery and ensures customer satisfaction. At the same time, a lower on-time pickup percentage is the other way around.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate this metric.</p><img alt=""on time pickup formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/kF2gAXcp1a76WOpJVPtkmhJU.png""><p>Any on-time pickup value above 90% is considered acceptable for most logistic managers, while anything below that needs improvement in terms of truck turning rate, staffing, or loading capabilities.</p><h3>KPI #12. On-time Delivery Percentage</h3><p>Do you know why brands like Amazon and Walmart are so strict about on-time delivery (of course, except during the pandemic)?</p><p>Because this metric significantly impacts customer satisfaction and loyalty. On-time delivery is the percentage of products delivered on time to customers vs. the total no. of orders shipped over a period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>On-time delivery measures the success delivery rate for an entire order, and not in parts or segments. This KPIs is the heart and soul of the logistics industry or department.</p><p>It demonstrates your overall efficiency of logistics operations and how well things are put in place to get customers their orders on time. </p><p>A lower on-time delivery percentage indicates poor carrier and transportation services and might eventually repel customers from purchasing your product.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate on-time delivery:</p><img alt=""on time delivery formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/91tjnT94rxnsLxoHkXRIxqVFgGg.png""><h3>KPI #13. Order Accuracy</h3><p>What if you were waiting for a Macbook and got delivered an iPad? Or even worse, an iPad with a broken screen?</p><p>To avoid such customer nightmares, an order accuracy metric comes into play.</p><p>Order accuracy measures the number of orders packed, transported, and delivered perfectly vs. the total number of orders shipped over a period. In short it shows you the number of perfect orders.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>High order accuracy helps you stay in business, if your order accuracy is significantly low, no one would like to buy from you. </p><p>Moreover, poor order accuracy results in a higher product return rate, costing you time, resources, and revenue.</p><p>It also shows the efficiency of your supply chain and delivery services, encouraging customers to buy from you repeatedly.</p><p>Use this formula to calculate the order accuracy rate.</p><img alt=""order accuracy rate"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/EmvW1z5K5MY1tK5tv7pcs5ULgQ.png""><h3>KPI #14. Cost Per Pound</h3><p>You must have seen airlines measuring your luggage by weight and not by numbers.</p><p>Or, you might have paid extra delivery charges on orders that take space and more weight.</p><p>In both cases, the weight of the object matters. Hence, cost per pound is a performance metric that measures the cost incurred of shipments compared to their weight in pounds (preferable unit).</p><p>Here's a simple formula to measure this KPI.</p><img alt=""cost per pound formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1aMjIdrAjQT23WDycy0hyfhIBY.png""><p>For example, a shipment of 2,000 Lbs of goods costs you $800. Therefore, cost per pound equals 800 / 2000, i.e., $0.4.</p><p>Note: The average industry cost per pound is anywhere between $0.06 and $0.75.</p><h3>KPI #15. Warehousing Cost</h3><p>The warehousing cost refers to the amount of money spent on goods while they are lying in the warehouse. Generally, it includes the cost of storage, such as labor costs, loading and unloading costs, energy cost, and more.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This is a vital metric for companies that produce delicate goods. For example, packed food products might require cold storage, which will incur higher electricity bills, trained employees, and adequate space and maintenance of the warehouse.</p><p>Likewise, this metric also shares insights around warehouse dwell time and how the work there can be optimized for better functioning.</p><p>Warehousing cost is a component of another logistic KPI, transportation cost. </p><p>Using this KPI, logistic managers can also determine which warehouse operation is costing them a fortune and can work on effective cost-cutting strategies.</p><h2>How To Track Logistic KPIs In Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad kpi tracking tool "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/IkoI3DM341R2ghEDs772ATQ.png""><p>Datapad is a mobile-friendly dashboarding tool that allows logistic managers to track, monitor, and obtain data-driven insights on their logistic operations via mobile phones.</p><p>In context to logistics, Datapad allows you to quickly create new KPIs, set a goal, and track progress in real-time. </p><p>Plus, since we now know that logistic KPIs can be subjective in nature, our tool provides easy-to-understand data visualization elements and charts to make things work for partners and stakeholders.</p><p>Here's how you can create a logistic KPI dashboard in Datapad.</p><h3>Step 1: Create a Workplace</h3><p>To get started, download our app on your mobile devices (available for both Android and iPhone).</p><p>Then, sign up with your preferred email address.

We’ll also discuss the 15 most important KPIs one should measure to streamline daily business operations.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p><h2>What Are Operational KPIs?</h2><p>Operational KPIs are KPIs or metrics in operations are quantifiable measurements used by business owners to gauge the performance and efficiency of their day-to-day operations. </p><p>If you're among those companies who track their daily operations by the number of trucks that went in and out or counted the number of employees milling around, you are lagging far behind your competitors.</p><p>Progressive companies use operations KPIs to track and analyze their day-to-day working efficiency. From production to sales, marketing, and HR - operation KPIs measure the performance of each department on a daily basis. </p><h3>Benefits of Tracking KPIs in Operation</h3><p>The best thing about tracking KPIs in operation is that you get real-time data. You’re aware of how core operations are functioning as they happen.</p><p>This becomes vital in time-sensitive situations where prompt decision-making is required.</p><p>Suppose, we say, the trajectory for a manufacturing operation KPI is projecting negative trends, you can instantly dig deeper into the problem and prevent your business from any downtime.</p><p>Likewise, if the operational metric is positive, operations managers can do more of what works best for the organization.</p><p>To ease your trouble, we have already researched and listed the most important metrics to track in multiple operations in a business.</p><h2>15 Best Operational Metrics That Every Business Must Measure</h2><p>We interviewed experts to give you the most important metrics to track for your business.In this section we are going to give KPI examples for operations that you should be tracking in 2023. </p><h3>#1. Finance Operations KPIs </h3><h4>KPI #1. Working Capital</h4><p>Working capital is the sum of dollars remaining with a company after subtracting its current assets from current liabilities. </p><p>Your assets include your on-hand cash, accounts receivable, inventory, etc. </p><p>While your current liabilities are all that you owe to pay within the financial year, such as bank operating credit, loans, taxes, and other expenses due.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>In simpler terms, working capital means immediately available cash.</p><p>When it comes to day-to-day operations, you need some capital in hand to operate – money that can be put to work at the moment. </p><p>This KPI is all about measuring your business’s financial health to fulfill short-term financial obligations.</p><p>Besides, it can also help financial managers decide how aggressive a company should be in pursuing growth opportunities.</p><p>Here’s the formula to calculate working capital:</p><img alt=""working capita formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BEXedujlbdsEsifrEG3qaaSCwkM.jpeg""><p><strong>Note:</strong> High working capital results from two reasons, either your company is performing efficiently well, or it’s not investing the excess cash.</p><h4>KPI #2. Net Profit Margin</h4><p>If you’ve watched Shark Tank, you might’ve heard of net profit margin or gross profit margin almost in every entrepreneur’s pitch.</p><p>The net profit margin is the profit made by a business after subtracting all operating expenses (including depreciation and taxes) from the total revenue.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>As we said, this KPI is directly related to your business's financial health. It shows how efficient a company is in turning revenue into profits.</p><p>The net profit margin reflects the profitability of a company. At the end of the day, this is what matters to a CFO. Besides, the KPIs also help you track your company’s status quo among its competitors. </p><p>In most cases, net profit is calculated as a percentage, the higher the net profit, the more profitable your business stays. Plus, a surplus net profit also shows how fast your business can grow in the long term.</p><p>Here’s a simple formula to calculate net profit:</p><img alt=""net profit margin formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0T3gHbF9thNLl7iy05ZPVkN9T8.jpeg""><h4>KPI #3. Cash Conversion Cycle [CCC]</h4><p>The cash conversion cycle is the amount of time it takes for a company to convert its inventory into cash.</p><p>It takes into account both the time it takes to sell inventory, and the time it takes to collect payment from customers.</p><p>Track this operation KPI if you want to know more about your business’s cash flow.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>CFOs would always want to see the CCC remain stagnant or decrease over time. This is because the longer it would take to convert goods into cash, the longer it might take you to clear out your liabilities.</p><p>Basically, a higher CCC will impact your inventory purchasing power, working capital, and day-to-day operations.</p><p>Here’s how you can measure your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):</p><img alt=""CCC formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/kvAr2MEq4zD0F1hOvPnbfTLJko.jpeg""><p>Here,</p><p>DIO means days of inventory outstanding</p><p>DSO refers to days Sales Outstanding </p><p>And DPO refers to the days payables outstanding. </p><p>CCC is generally measured in days, and if the number of days starts increasing, an in-depth analysis should be made to screw in the weaker points.</p><p>However, the cash conversion cycle differs across industries based on the nature of business operations, so there's no defined strategy to ace this KPI.</p><h3>#2. Manufacturing Operations KPIs</h3><h4>KPI #4. Throughput</h4><p>Throughput is a crucial manufacturing KPI as it measures the capability of your manufacturing plant to produce the number of goods in a certain period.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>Throughput measures the production capability of your machines, product line, or plant in real time. Thereby helping production managers get insights into the day-to-day production line functioning and optimum utilization of machinery.</p><p>Manufacturing and production lines are time-sensitive processes. A lazy downtime or breakdown can disfigure your overall operations. Hence, a manufacturing head always stays tuned to the overall throughput rate.</p><p>A constant decrease in throughput rate means your production line is facing an issue. For the most part, you can increase it by reducing machine downtime, replacing the human touch with automation, or reducing short-stops. </p><p>Here’s a quick formula to calculate Throughput:</p><img alt=""throughput formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/dSjcHX6TQBPsqG3fHlLVDWbSdf4.jpeg""><p>To calculate the Throughput Rate, simply multiply the above result by 100.</p><h4>KPI #5. Machine Downtime Rate</h4><p>Machine downtime rate refers to the rate at which the manufacturing equipment is suffering from planned or unplanned stops. This may be due to scheduled maintenance drives or sudden equipment failures (or malfunctioning).</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>An hour of machine downtime can cost a company an <a href=""https://www.aberdeen.com/techpro-essentials/stat-of-the-week-the-rising-cost-of-downtime/"">average of $260,000</a>. But besides the monetary losses, you must also count on the lost time and productivity.</p><p>So, as a whole, an hour of downtime can cost you more than a lost sale.</p><p>To reduce machine downtime rate, make sure of these three things:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Establish failures codes for the machine's so that workers are aware of the issue before the machine stops working</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Perform preventive maintenance like regular checkups and servicing</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Conduct daily inspection of machines before starting the production unit to ensure machines are lubricated and good to function</p></li></ul><p>The formula for calculating machine downtime is pretty straightforward:</p><img alt=""downtime formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RhzkwsWsXANdCbsJMwtIMBJXHs.jpeg""><h4>KPI #6. Capacity Utilization</h4><p>As the term suggests, capacity utilization is the measure of how efficiently the production capacity is utilized when compared with the optimum utilization.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>After having spent $$$ on high-end machinery, you don’t want to keep them idle.</p><p>The point is to maximize the capacity utilization so that your machines work at an ideal cycle time. And when they do, they’re said to be working at 100% capacity.</p><p>This KPI also gives a snapshot of the maximum order quantity that your production line can fulfill when utilizing its resources at the optimum level. </p><p>Thereby allowing production managers to make data-driven decisions on the orders to be taken and the delivery time to be provided - for transparency in the organization.</p><img alt=""capacity utilization formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/sgSP8T7ifEcqXNn6gn5MktsYas.jpeg""><p>The higher the percentage, the greater the chances to scale up your operations in the long-term and vice versa.</p><h3>#3. Marketing Operations KPIs</h3><h4>KPI #7. Click-Through Rate [CTR]</h4><p>The click-through rate is a business performance metric that reveals the number of clicks your ad receives vs. the number of impressions it gets (used to track social media posts, website traffic, etc.). </p><p>Simply put, this KPI measures the percentage of impressions that resulted in a click.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>Marketing professionals use this key metric to get a better understanding of a company’s marketing campaigns. It’s measured per 100 impressions and popularly used to gauge PPC ads.</p><p>Besides, the click-through rate determines how well your headlines, CTAs, blogs, and on-page content are resonating with your audience.</p><p>As per Wordstream, the average click-through rate across all industries is 6.18%.</p><img alt=""average cost per click infographics"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZrqtY7sbkMP4wgt9GfCGSgcE6I.png""><p><a href=""https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2021/10/13/search-advertising-benchmarks"">Source</a></p><p>So, if your CTR is lower than 6%, you need to address your marketing team immediately. An ideal CTR percentage varies from industry to industry, so you may opt for strategies based on your industry type.</p><p>Here’s how you can calculate CTR:</p><img alt=""ctr formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nglrU9Dl5edVqpaZIU43M3tLg4.png""><p>For example, if your ad has 1000 views and gets 20 clicks. Your ideal CTR is 2%.</p><h4>KPI #8. Cost Per Acquisition [CPA]</h4><p>Cost per acquisition is the total money, time, and resources you and your business spend on acquiring new customers. </p><p>In contrast to other marketing KPIs like conversion rate or cost per impression, CPA focuses on the cost for the overall journey from first contact to becoming a customer.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>Cost per acquisition is a refined version of customer acquisition cost. It demonstrates the costs incurred to transform a potential lead into a customer. </p><p>This metric helps you evaluate the ROI on customers, meaning it tells you if you're spending more on acquiring a customer than the customer lifetime value (CLV).</p><p>In fact, if your CPA is higher than the CLV, you might soon be dipping into losses because the money you are spending is more than the revenue generated.</p><p>CPA can be calculated by dividing the money spent on a campaign by the number of customers acquired from the campaign.</p><img alt=""CPA Forumal"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5E5J4Lev36GkcA27h39HEt883E.jpeg""><h4>KPI #9. Customer Retention Rate</h4><p>Customer retention is the number of customers that a company retains in a certain time period. This KPI accounts for your customer satisfaction efforts and strategies that you put up to keep your customers engaged and loyal to your brand.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>Comparably, retaining existing customers will do more good to your business than acquiring new customers. </p><p>You may ask why?</p><p>An increase in CRR by 5% leads to an increase in <a href=""https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/the-economics-of-e-loyalty"">profits by 25% to 95%</a>. While acquiring new customers may cost you 50 times more, it won't yield any immediate sales.</p><p>This is because existing customers are more likely to try a new product and <a href=""https://www.business2community.com/customer-experience/why-your-existing-customers-are-your-best-customers-02199165"">spend 31%</a> more than new customers.</p><p>So, the customer retention rate is a crucial KPI that marketers track for a substantial increase in the company's revenue.</p><p>Here’s how you can calculate it:</p><img alt=""CRR formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/2WAmjHj2mwPvmxAVcpWOHl3ixMI.jpeg""><p>Here,</p><p>CE is the number of customers at the end of the period</p><p>CN is the number of new customers acquired during the period</p><p>CS is the number of customers at the start of the period</p><h3>#4. Sales Operations KPIs</h3><h4>KPI #10. Sales Cycle Length</h4><p>Sales cycle length measures the average time taken to close a sale from the time of first interaction with the lead. It might be hours, days, or weeks, depending on your sales team's efficiency and, of course, the decision maker.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>Measuring this KPI helps you answer three important questions:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How long does it take to get the data ready for prospecting?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How long does it take to get that first meeting booked with the key decision-maker?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The time it takes to close the deal? </p></li></ul><p>Getting answers to these questions helps you improve your sales processes and train your sales team in a better way. Plus, you can also identify any upsell opportunities lying between the sales cycle.</p><p>How to calculate it?</p><img alt=""sales cycle length formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QDO0apzGdiPQTFcf5iHHJs68F0s.jpeg""><h4>KPI #11. Close Rate</h4><p>The close rate is the percentage of prospects that are converted into actual customers over a given period of time.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>This KPI demonstrates the efficiency of sales professionals or your sales team in getting you valuable customers. </p><p>A lower close rate means your sales rep is not performing well in terms of converting leads into customers. This can be improved by providing proper training for sales calls, persuasive skills, customer-centric sales scripts, and more.</p><p>Here’s how you calculate the close rate:</p><img alt=""close rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pbRyWQgfpBQWIwlzbKVoXjh5k.jpeg""><h4>KPI #12. Churn Rate</h4><p>Churn Rate refers to the rate at which customers stop using your products or services. Typically, this KPI is measured in percentage and tells you how satisfied your customers are with your products or services.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>Churn rate helps you identify how your retention strategies are working. Moreover, you get to know the relationship with your customers.</p><p>That is why a higher churn rate depicts vital issues either in your product quality or your customer relation management reps, any of these will need immediate attention. The longer a customer stays with your business, the lower your business's churn rate.</p><p>Here’s how you calculate the churn rate:</p><img alt=""churn rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/e8k4iDkjIhC7MkCUM1AMt86Mps.jpeg""><h3>#5. Staffing and Human Resource Operations KPIs</h3><h4>KPI #13. Overtime Hours</h4><p>Overtime hours is the measure of extra hours that employees are working post the determined working hours.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>Sometimes economic growth or a high volume of orders can lead to extra workload, making employees work overtime. Although, if this happens once in a blue moon, it's good for employee productivity.</p><p>But working overtime way too often can have a negative impact on employees' self-esteem and hamper overall productivity.</p><p>This KPI can also be used during recruitment processes since you will be able to demonstrate the company’s work environment and use this as an argument for hiring negotiations with potential candidates. </p><img alt=""pay rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/GfwSc2Jcj3XRnKZMZyo4X2eyJQ.png""><p><strong>Note:</strong> The number of hours can be on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.</p><h4>KPI #14. Absenteeism Rate</h4><p>Absenteeism rate refers to the frequency at which employee(s) are taking leave from the organization.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>This KPI inclines toward the company's work culture. If a number of employees take leave very often, it can negatively impact the overall performance of the company and its efficiency in meeting deadlines.</p><p>Here’s how you can calculate the absenteeism rate:</p><img alt=""absenteeism rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/be3s9rWDZgNTGvTBoogHvDZW4KE.jpeg""><h4>KPI #15. Employee Turnover Rate </h4><p>Employee turnover rate is the measurement of the number of employees who leave an organization during a specified time period.</p><h5>Why Is It Important?</h5><p>Turnover can be of two types: <em>Voluntary and Involuntary</em>.</p><p>Voluntary turnover is when an employee wishes to leave the organization due to personal factors.</p><p>Involuntary turnover is when the organization finds the employee unfit for the position or terminates him/her due to interdisciplinary actions.</p><p>In both cases, the company faces a higher turnover rate. Hence, they need to perform the hiring and training process from ground zero.</p><p>Eventually, this costs organizations their time, money, and resources. Therefore, a higher turnover rate is deemed to be poor by HRs and recruiters.</p><p>Here’s how you calculate it:</p><img alt=""talent turnover rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lS80rloNz5qTnxgSsAH9QSJ3mc.png""><p>Here,</p><p>L represents the number of employees who left</p><p>B refers to the number of employees at the beginning of the period</p><p>And E is the number of employees at the end of the period</p><h2>How to Track KPIs in Operations with Datapad</h2><img alt=""datapad homepage"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/FwAbpwRdYgQQ9SN2mw6KanEs0E.png""><p>Datapad is a mobile-friendly dashboarding tool.

So if you have no idea how your product’s being manufactured and distributed, your business will most likely fail with time.</p><p>So what do you do to avoid this? The answer’s quite simple - Track all the supply chain KPIs!</p><p>Tracking KPIs regularly can help you rectify problems and ensure that your store's supply-to-demand ratio is always even.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, you will discover what supply chain KPIs are and know about the 15 best KPIs to track to increase your business’s supply chain efficiency.</p><h2>What are Supply Chain KPIs?</h2><p>Supply chain KPIs are barometers that help you track how effectively your logistics targets are met. These metrics give clear insights into inventory management, order fulfillment rates, inventory-to-sales ratio, and other helpful things.</p><p>On top of that, these parameters help you set informed future goals for several business activities based on the progress you make on the go.</p><p>Let's take an example of company A which has been selling sneakers for over 3 years.</p><p>Although the company makes fancy sneakers, it hasn’t been profitable yet.</p><p>But why is that so?</p><p>That’s because of the poor inventory management.&nbsp;</p><p>But how come the company didn’t know about that until now?</p><p>Had the company tracked its inventory turnover, it would have got a clear idea about the percentage of stocks sold over a specific time.</p><p>This way, the company would have replaced the outdated inventory stocks with the new ones at the right time, which gives a greater chance to fulfill the customer's needs and turn the tables.</p><p>As you can see from the example above, supply chain metrics reveal shortcomings allowing you to leverage your business to be more productive and ultimately more profitable.</p><p>Now that you're familiar with the basic idea of supply chain metrics let's look at the 15 best key performance indicators that help improve your supply chain practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>What are the Top 15 KPIs for Supply Chain Management?</h2><h3>#1. Perfect Order</h3><p>The perfect order rate measures the effectiveness of a supply chain.&nbsp;</p><p>Briefly, it's defined as the number of orders delivered to customers without any incidents, where incidents mean damaged goods, wrong delivery, or late shipments.</p><p>It’s one of the most critical supply chain KPIs that gives you insights about issues such as inventory losses, damages and delays, and inaccuracies in your business.</p><p>Moreover, it also lets you track your delivery operations, manage costs, and has a direct impact on customer satisfaction.</p><p>You can measure the perfect order rate by using a simple mathematical formula:</p><img alt=""perfect order formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/uFNQueoYnXK0SuBLqsOMHnHmsKY.png""><h3>#2. Cash-to-Cash Cycle Time</h3><p>Cash-to-cash cycle time reveals a lot about the efficiency of your supply chain practices. It represents the amount of time taken to transform your raw materials to bonafide cash flow.</p><p>In other words, it reveals how much time your business takes between paying suppliers for raw materials and receiving payment from customers for selling the product.</p><p>There are three main components of calculating this metric:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Days of inventory (DOI)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Days of payables (DOP)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Days sales outstanding (DSO)</p></li></ul><p>You can simply put all these into a simple formula and get cash-to-cash cycle time:</p><img alt=""cash to cash cycle formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/4EMBZ4Im7y5nPeVNZVrObL3IUs.png""><p><strong>Note: </strong>A lower value of this KPI indicates an increased efficiency of your supply chain management process.</p><h3>#3. Customer Order Cycle Time</h3><p>Customer order cycle time is the time taken between receiving a purchase order from the customer and the moment it gets delivered to the customer.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s one of the most important metrics used by companies to distinguish themselves from their competition and provide a positive customer experience.</p><p>Clearly, this supply chain KPI says a great deal about the responsiveness of your supply chain practices. Moreover, examining this metric also tells a lot about other vital elements like inventory management, invoicing, and payments.</p><p>Here’s the formula to calculate the customer order time:</p><img alt=""customer order cycle time formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Z377rnAP7yRd13lybQCSuyno.png""><h3>#4. Fill Rate</h3><p>Customers expect on-time delivery, and as a result, it's important for businesses to monitor the order-filling process. That's why fill rate is such a crucial supply chain KPI that businesses should track.</p><p>Fill rate is defined as the percentage of orders you’re able to meet without any backorders or stockouts on the first shipment. It provides a comprehensive view of your supply chain performance.</p><p>Tracking fill rate helps businesses measure the demand for different SKUs in the inventory. Not only that, but it also gives a clear insight into the delivery operations, which is essential in meeting customer demands.</p><p>You can simply calculate the fill rate using this formula:</p><img alt=""fill rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/dy5tEUHnWkGW9JZNntwUWF7S0.png""><h3>#5. Inventory Days of Supply</h3><p>Also called the Inventory Period, it represents the average time your inventory takes before it needs restocking.</p><p>Currently, it has become one of the most important KPIs a business must track.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you know why?</p><p>That's because if a big chunk of your capital sits ideally in your inventory, it's of no good use to your business.&nbsp;</p><p>That's why it's necessary to track your inventory so that it gets replenished just before any extraordinary situation arises and not unnecessarily.</p><p>To know about your inventory status, you can use this simple formula:</p><img alt=""inventory days of supply formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/w3QZEXtQiAADKnqmNyyznjauhM.png""><p>A lower value of inventory days of supply KPI reduces the risk of outdated inventory, which in turn helps businesses to have a more balanced inventory policy.&nbsp;</p><h3>#6. Freight Bill Accuracy</h3><p>Freight bill accuracy is determined as the percentage of error-free freight bills out of total freight bills.&nbsp;</p><p>It's an integral part of smooth supply chain operation, and any issue with this particular KPI would prove detrimental to your business.</p><p>Tracking this particular metric helps you find the blind spots in shipping and billing operations which points your business to a path of growth.</p><p>Other than that, it also helps businesses meet customer demands in an accurate manner.</p><p>Here’s how you can calculate freight bill accuracy:</p><img alt=""freight bill accuracy formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lgo5M8IZNkJFUeczcCH2IMAXs.png""><h3>#7. Days Sales Outstanding [DSO]</h3><p>Days sales outstanding is a measurement of the estimated amount of time a company takes to collect revenue from the customers once the sale’s been completed.</p><p>In simple terms, it tells how swift is the process of revenue generation of a company.</p><p>Not just that, it also showcases a business's financial health. The lower the number, the better.&nbsp;</p><p>When the day's sales outstanding value is low, it means that a company is taking less time to collect payments from its customers, which encourages the cash flow and maximizes profitability.</p><p>On the flip side, a higher DSO can stunt the cash flow of a company which can severely impact the business operations. And that’s why businesses need to track this KPI.</p><p>You can calculate the DSO with a simple formula:</p><img alt=""days sales outstanding formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/txwY0rfOyBk6fh2STdj9W3rP3b0.png""><p><strong>Note</strong>: Days sales outstanding is usually calculated every month.</p><h3>#8. Inventory Turnover&nbsp;</h3><p>Inventory turnover gives an idea about how many times your entire inventory stocks have dried up during a certain time frame.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a KPI that makes sure a company doesn't keep more products in their inventory than required. In other words, calculating inventory turnover will streamline your supply chain process.</p><p>Tracking this KPI can help you measure the efficiency of the production process, marketing, and sales operations, and order fulfillment capabilities.</p><p>It also covers all the critical business aspects needed to boost your brand authority-that makes it overriding to calculate this particular logistics KPI.</p><p>You just need two elements to track Inventory turnover ratio - Cost of goods sold and average inventory.</p><img alt=""inventory turnover formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QV1xOsVIAHENcVmJIt3di63ag.png""><p>A significantly higher inventory turnover value substantiates efficient inventory management, meaning more profitability.</p><h3>#9. Gross Margin Return on Investment [GMROI]</h3><p>Essentially, maintaining a positive ROI on a consistent basis reveals the profitability of a business. That’s why every business eyes for maximum return on its investments for each activity it undertakes.</p><p>In supply chain management, gross margin ROI reveals the gross profit gained from the investment you do for your inventory. This helps you to identify the bottlenecks in your inventory management practices.</p><p>What's more, you can use this information to invest in inventory items that are the best performers and improve your business's overall operations.</p><p>Here’s how you can calculate the gross ROI:</p><img alt=""gross margin return on investment formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/4uA73c67bSxtsY70QdPsI9Jadd4.png""><h3>#10. Inventory Velocity</h3><p>Spending extra on inventory stocks can drain your resources in no time. That’s why it’s necessary to optimize your inventory levels time-to-time.</p><p>Inventory velocity is a decisive supply chain key performance indicator that estimates the percentage of inventory to be consumed within a certain time frame.</p><p>This KPI proves to be pivotal in providing clear insights about warehousing operations. Moreover, tracking this metric also tells you about the performance of SKUs.</p><p>What's more, it helps you minimize the risk of surplus and outdated inventory issues, which in turn gives you a greater chance of meeting the customer's expectations.</p><p>You can calculate inventory velocity as shown below:</p><img alt=""inventory velocity formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QuLW6jV5HzJop0pcVfKH2GBpo8Q.png""><h3>#11. Warehousing Costs</h3><p>While warehouse costs vary based on the number of storage spaces and cost distribution, it’s necessary to monitor them to reduce unwanted expenses.</p><p>Warehouse operations include several direct and indirect costs like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Labor costs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Rent of the place</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Raw material costs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Utility bills</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Warehouse management costs</p></li></ul><p>This KPI gives a holistic view of how your warehouse operations are performing and how you can keep the costs on the lower side.&nbsp;</p><p>This way, you can avoid unnecessary costs and manage the operations in a more efficient way.</p><p>To calculate warehousing costs, all you have to do is add every element that adds up to your warehouse cost.</p><h3>#12. Supply Chain Costs vs. Sales</h3><p>Tracking business expenditure is the first step to understanding where you’re spending more and where there’s a scope for potential saving. And so, it’s important for businesses to cut costs where it actually makes sense.</p><p>The supply chain, as a portion of sales, represents the total cost of the supply chain as a percentage of the total sales for a particular time period. Basically, it tracks how much you're spending relative to a whole.</p><p>Sometimes the extra costs involved in delivering your products might decrease profitability.&nbsp;</p><p>Tracking this KPI, you can optimize the supply chain by reducing the additional costs incorporated into your cost of sold goods.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, you can check the health of your spending analysis by comparing your costs with the sales and boost your net profit percentage.</p><h3>#13. Inventory to Sales Ratio</h3><p>Efficient management of inventory is essential to firms, especially when they've to deal with large stocks. For this, they need to keep their stocks balanced so that there's never too much or too little.</p><p>The inventory to sales ratio measures the amount of inventory for sale compared to the actual sales that are being made.</p><p>This helps businesses adjust their stock order to cope with the unpredictable changes arising due to fluctuations in the market.</p><p>Here’s how you can calculate inventory to sales ratio:</p><img alt=""inventory sales ratio formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/JFqCmFWED07hCJTArlIugyJQ28.png""><p>A lower value indicates excellent business performance meaning higher sales and lower inventory.&nbsp;</p><h3>#14. Pick and Pack Cycle Time</h3><p>With customer expectations skyrocketing in recent times, it has become indispensable for companies to adopt practices that give them a fair, competitive advantage over others.</p><p>Pick and pack cycle time is one such metric that differentiates a top performer from an average one. It captures the time taken by companies to put the product from warehouses to prepare it for shipping.</p><p>It says a lot about the efficiency of your supply chain practices and their weak spots.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use this information to meet existing customer demands and acquire new ones too. In addition, you can also take targeted actions to implement a robust logistics process.</p><h3>#15. Reason for Product Return</h3><p>Let’s face it; it’s always annoying to be on the opposite side of a return order. Meaning if you’re the owner of a business getting multiple returns from numerous customers, it might annoy you.</p><p>It's not just annoying, but a significant increase in return orders might lead to declining revenue and ultimately break your business apart.</p><p>But the pain doesn’t stop here.&nbsp;</p><p>If customers are returning your products due to some technical difficulty or bad quality, the review sites will be a nightmare for you.</p><p>Getting 1 and 2 star reviews on big websites like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, etc. will be hard to recover from.</p><p>To track the major reasons behind product return, first, ask every customer who has ever returned your product about the reason for return and make a note of it.</p><p>For example, the reason for return could be - Defective product, sending out the wrong product color, a different product from the image shown, and many more.</p><p>Try finding out the major reasons for your product return and act on it immediately. That’s because the return rate of a product could make or break your business.</p><h2>How to Track Your Supply Chain KPIs Easily with Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad homepage"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RGsS77IMrcCqTAK3GRFCavYbS6c.png""><p>Tracking Supply Chain KPIs with Datapad is a quick and easy process.

That’s a significant number.</p><p>If you’re a business owner or marketer looking to get an edge on the competition, then tracking the best Google Analytics KPIs is a must.&nbsp;</p><p>With the right KPIs, you can gain great insights into how your website is performing, where your viewers are coming from, and how to improve your online presence.</p><p>In this article, you’ll discover the top 12 KPIs Google Analytics KPIs you must track to stay on top of your competition.</p><p>So let’s get going!</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZRUbWfTkMuvJqGpArnMmpGRiA.gif""><h2>What Are Google Analytics KPIs?</h2><p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Google Analytics are quantifiable measurements used to collect, analyze, and optimize user behavior on a website.&nbsp;</p><p>They are the metrics used to measure the performance of your website or app. These metrics can help you gain insights into how people are interacting with your website, where they are coming from, and how to improve your online presence.&nbsp;</p><p>By tracking the right KPIs, you can better understand how to optimize your website and maximize conversions.</p><p>Let's dive deeper into how Google Analytics KPIs can help you increase revenue and skyrocket your website's performance. 🚀</p><h2>What Are the Benefits of Tracking Google Analytics KPIs?</h2><h3>#1. Understanding Website And Online Marketing Performance</h3><p>Tell us - How would you measure success in the digital space? 🤔</p><p>You certainly need some indicators that can vouch for your website's performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Google Analytics KPIs are a set of those leading and lagging indicators that help you understand your overall website performance.</p><p>From why someone visited your website to which device they used and what actions they took after visiting your website – you have dedicated metrics for everything in Google analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific metrics such as new vs. unique users, conversion rate, retention rate, and many such KPIs deliver in-depth insights to gauge your marketing efforts over time.&nbsp;</p><h3>#2. Identifying Opportunities for Improvement In Your Website</h3><p><strong>FACT: </strong>Everything that can be measured can be improved.</p><p>The benefits of tracking Google Analytics KPIs are not limited to measuring performance. These metrics help you get into the neck of the woods to identify opportunities for improvement.</p><p>For example, you can look at the conversion rate of different landing pages and identify underperforming pages.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, certain metrics such as website loading time, number of sessions, and engagement rate give you a better understanding of why and where your website is losing potential customers.</p><p>Let's take an example of an eCommerce store using Google Analytics KPIs.</p><p>The average cart abandonment rate (people who add products to their cart but don’t do the checkout process) is close to <a href=""https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate"">69.99%</a>. Which means, a significant portion of store visitors add products to their cart but exist without buying them.&nbsp;</p><p>Using Google Analytics, you can constantly measure your card abandonment rate and work on strategies such as exit offers and eye-catching deals to persuade customers into buying from you.</p><h3>#3. Measuring the Effectiveness of Marketing Campaigns</h3><p>The effectiveness of marketing campaigns is derived from the percentage of users who actually take action after seeing or hearing about your product.</p><p><strong>Think about it:</strong> You’ve successfully launched a marketing campaign, say for a webinar, and want users to click on the link and register from a dedicated landing page on your website.</p><p>In this case, Google Analytics KPIs will help you measure:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Total number of impressions on the post</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Total number of website visitors (top channels)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>People who spent time on the landing page (average session duration)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>People who clicked on the registration link (click-through-rate)</p></li></ul><p>And it's not limited to all these.</p><p>Using Google Analytics KPIs, you can see how one campaign performs better than another on the website, and now you can optimize your other campaigns to match the better-performing one, or simply double down on the campaign that gives you the best results.</p><p>When you can make direct data comparisons between your ad campaigns, no matter the source, you will create a better online ad strategy, prioritizing winning campaigns and platforms.</p><p>From CTA clicks to form submissions and downloads to signing up for a newsletter – any form of engagement from the user's end that occurs as a result of an ongoing marketing campaign can be easily tracked and measured under the Google Analytics KPI dashboard.</p><h3>#4. Providing Data-Driven Insights</h3><p>Google Analytics KPIs eliminate the guesswork from the process of measuring and analyzing user behavior.</p><p>It provides actionable data-driven insights regarding your website and online marketing performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Insights like what percentage of visitors convert into actual leads, channels bringing in the most traffic, most viewed pages, and much more.</p><p>Now that you know a great deal about Google Analytics KPIs and the benefits of tracking them, it’s time to list down the most important website KPIs to track for business owners.</p><h2>What Are the 12 Best Google Analytics KPIs to Track?</h2><h2>#1. Organic Traffic</h2><p>Organic traffic accounts for the number of website visitors that land on your website from unpaid sources such as search engine result pages (SERPs).&nbsp;</p><p>Besides being affordable, good organic traffic (that comes with phenomenal SEO) also helps improve the DA of any website on a search engine.</p><h3>How to Track Organic Traffic?</h3><p>To track organic traffic on GA4, go to <strong>Reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Acquisition</strong> &gt; <strong>User or Traffic Acquisition</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/evLliwSrJUql3GxIil386R0gLnM.png""><p>Here, you can find an '<strong>overtime</strong>' chart depicting traffic from various sources.

New vs. Returning Users</h2><p>New users are those users who have visited your website for the first time, as per Google's tracking snippet.</p><p>Returning users, on the other hand, are users who have visited your website or app in the past but found it interesting enough to visit again.</p><p>So the question is, how does Google differentiate between new and returning users?</p><p>When someone views your website, Google's tracking snippet searches for a tracking cookie on the user's device:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>If the cookie is not found on the device, Google creates one and marks the user as a <strong>'new'</strong> user</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>If the cookie is available on the device, Google considers this a <strong>'returning'</strong> user and starts a new session</p></li></ul><h3>How to Track New vs. Returning Users?</h3><p>You can access new vs. returning users' insights via audience overview in universal analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in GA4, the measurement process is a little different.

Average Engagement Time Per User</h2><p>Average engagement time per user measures the time duration that your web page was in focus on a user's screen. This can help you understand when users actively use your website vs. just have the page open in a tab but not displayed.</p><p>An excellent average engagement time on a website per user is anywhere between <a href=""https://nobleintentstudio.com/blog/ga4-is-all-about-engagement-what-are-good-engagement-metrics/"">0:27-1:30</a>.</p><h3>How to Track Average Engagement Time?</h3><p>To track the average engagement time per user, click on <strong>Life Cycle</strong> in the left menu bar of GA4. Then click on, <strong>Engagements</strong> &gt; <strong>Engagement Overview</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/uxAs8FNm1lnFnxa2ybHCYLN98s.png""><h2>#4. Engagement Rate</h2><p>The engagement rate measures the percentage of engaged sessions from the total number of sessions on your website.</p><p>In GA4, engagement rate essentially replaces bounce rate. Do you know why?</p><p>For instance, if a visitor landed on your page, downloaded a book, and then existed, your website would consider it a bounce. However, we can see the user is highly engaged with your website.</p><p>And that's why most companies, including Google, don’t focus much on low or high bounce rate metrics for measuring users' interests.</p><p>However, you can still add bounce rate in your dashboard by customizing your report view from the customize icon in the top right corner.</p><h3>How to Track Engagement Rate?</h3><p>Go to <strong>Reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Engagement</strong> &gt; <strong>Pages and Screens</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7xU9L52EwT94uKHh0qsvJ9BkMw.png""><p>In some cases, it's possible that engagement rate is not selected as a default metric, and hence it's nowhere in your dashboard.

User Retention Rate</h2><p>The user retention rate measures the percentage of users returning to your website or app over a given time frame.

Top Acquisition Channels</h2><p>Top Acquisition channels are GA metrics that allow you to measure overall website traffic generated from individual channels or sources and identify the best-performing channels.</p><p>The KPI helps you answer questions like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Where are new users coming from?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Which campaigns drive the most users to my website?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Are certain channels more effective at driving traffic to my website than others?</p></li></ul><p>Thereby helping you divert your surplus resources and budget on the winning horse.</p><h3>How to Track Top Acquisition Channels?</h3><p>Go to <strong>Reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Acquisition</strong> &gt; <strong>Traffic Acquisition</strong>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/jhIQKtPhUSBkPtS3Ob4tegKpE4.png""><p>Google Analytics, by default, shows traffic by channel group such as direct, organic, or referral.

User Stickiness Ratio</h2><p>The user stickiness ratio is a comparative metric that allows you to compare engagement rates by active users at a narrow time frame with their engagement over a broader time frame.</p><p>Basically, it's calculated based on how frequently users access your website. The higher the ratio, the more effective your retention strategies are functioning.</p><p>However, this metric was not available by default in Universal Analytics.

ARPU can be calculated by dividing the total amount of revenue generated by the company by the total number of active users (i.e., customers).</p><p>An increasing ARPU indicates improvement in the monetization of the user base.

Organizations use a mix of both to track what's most important.</p><p>Moreover, KPIs specifically help determine a company's strategic, financial, and operational achievements compared to its competitors.</p><p>From HR and managers to marketing and sales teams, key performance indicators help every area of the business move forward at the strategic level.</p><p>Although KPIs are subject to business operations and strategic goals, there are some that remain in common while measuring business performance.</p><p>Examples of KPIs:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Revenue KPIs:</strong> Measure the revenue earned by the company over time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Sales KPIs: </strong>Measure how sales are increasing or decreasing over time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Strategic KPIs:</strong> Measure the performance of strategies put in place</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Profit Margin:</strong> Evaluate how much profit you make per sale after deducting expenses</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Customer Service KPIs:</strong> Evaluate the impact of service on your customers and identify drawbacks</p></li></ul><p>Majority of KPIs are used to track your business performance, such as conversion rates, monthly sales growth, net cash flow, customer acquisition cost, and many more.</p><p>But to identify the most resourceful list of KPIs you will be tracking, you need answers to specific questions like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What is your ultimate business objective?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Why does this objective matter?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How are you planning to achieve this objective?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How will you know if you're making progress towards the goal?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How often will you review your progress?</p></li></ul><p>For example, if your business goal is to increase revenue by 20% by the end of the year, your KPIs to measure your goal may include monthly sales qualified, upselling success rate, customer acquisition cost, customer retention rate, and customer churn rate.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, a KPI can be a mix of multiple business metrics. Talking about metrics, let’s see what those are.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/what-is-a-kpi""><strong>What is KPI?: Beginners Guide You Have Been Looking For</strong></a></p><div><br></div><h2>What Are Metrics?&nbsp;</h2><p>Like KPIs, metrics are quantifiable measurements, but unlike KPIs, they are used to measure the performance of specific business processes at an operational level.&nbsp;</p><p>While some metrics closely accompany business objectives, they are not the most important indicators of your business performance.</p><img alt=""what are metrics"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/VuTvtKw4QIxvIfsgU6aseFnUVE.png""><p>For example, the number of users visiting your website is a critical metric to cover. But it's not something that drives the success of your business primarily.These metrics are called <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/vanity-metrics-to-stop-measuring-and-better-alternatives"">vanity metrics</a> that just make you feel good.&nbsp;</p><p>However, metrics are still relevant for tracking progress and making informed decisions.</p><p>Simply put, metrics are any type of data collected as a part of routine business operations. And hence, a mix of custom metrics can be used to define long-term KPIs for your business.</p><p>Our curiosity made us drill down a bit to identify why metrics are as crucial as KPIs, and we came across three significant reasons:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Metrics provides in-depth insights into how well particular campaigns, strategies, and activities are performing</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Metrics allow you to gauge business performance against competitors</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Metrics helps organizations identify the KPIs that are most important to an organization's success and how they interlink to each other</p></li></ol><p>For example, Email deliverability may not be an important KPI for your business, but the number of emails that convert to customers most likely will be. Therefore, you need to analyze that metric (deliverability) to achieve the KPI (email conversion).&nbsp;</p><p>Let's now see the difference between metrics and KPIs.</p><div><br></div><h2>What is the Difference Between a KPI and a Metric?&nbsp;</h2><p>Although some people use the terms KPI and metrics interchangeably, they aren't the same.</p><p>While metrics are units of measurement used in deriving KPIs, KPIs are metrics with a set goal for a certain period of time.</p><p>Or in general terms, we can say,<em> Every KPI is a metric, but not every metric is a KPI</em>.</p><p><strong>Food for thought:</strong> Context is where the most significant difference lies.&nbsp;</p><p>The difference is:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Metrics are effective for tracking performance across all areas of business</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>KPIs are effective for monitoring performance towards a specific goal or objective</p></li></ul><p>If this wasn't something you were looking for as a differentiator, we have compiled a list of five key differences between a metric and key performance indicator, and it goes like this:</p><h3>#1. Goals and Data Points</h3><p>KPI is a business outcome or goal that a specific department or team tries to achieve. Whereas metrics are scattered data points in your funnel that, when collected together, create a KPI.</p><p>Suppose you aim to achieve 500 registrations for your webinar by the end of the week. But to track that one goal, you need to measure the number of sign-ups, the number of website visitors, click on the ads (if you run PPC), and the conversion rate of the webinar landing page.</p><p>Here, the ultimate goal of 500 registrations is your KPI. At the same time, the other measurements, like the number of sign-ups, website visitors, etc., are your metrics.</p><p>A combination of specific metrics helps you define your progress towards your goal (KPI).</p><h3>#2. Determined Timeframe</h3><p>KPIs are tied to essential objectives and measure progress over a set period. On the other hand, metrics aren't necessarily bound to important goals or time frames.</p><p>KPIs are something that you want to achieve over the long term. For example, let's say you want to increase the number of customers by 50 over the next 90 days.</p><p>That sounds like a specific goal with a determined time frame - apt for being a KPI.</p><p>While metrics are just informational data such as likes on social posts, number of shares, pages per visit, and more of the same nature.</p><p>But it's not like you’re targeting these metrics for a cause or KPIs; you are tracking them as a part of your day-to-day operations in the digital paradigm.</p><h3>#3. Level of Focus</h3><p>The most apparent difference between KPIs and metrics is that metrics are broad and KPIs are focused.</p><p>When it comes to level of focus, KPIs and metrics are poles apart. In simpler terms, KPIs focus on results, while metrics concentrate on processes and problems.</p><p>The reason being, KPIs offer a high-level perspective for performance measurement. They represent key business goals and define activities and responsibilities for almost every department in the organization.</p><p>On the flip side, metrics are considered to be low-level indicators. They usually deal with day-to-day business processes and are specific to certain departments or business areas.</p><h3>#4. Superiority - Metrics vs KPI&nbsp;</h3><p>Although KPIs and metrics go hand-in-hand, one is superior to the other. Let's understand it in this way.</p><p>Suppose you're watching a movie; some characters appear less often, some appear in every scene, and then there are main characters, heroes and villains who steal the charm.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, the main characters are your KPIs, while others are your metrics - both bring something to the table, but not equally.</p><p>Your ultimate business goal (KPI) is what defines your metrics revolving around them. And we may conclusively say KPI has the upper hand while strategizing your business plan.</p><h3>#5. Every KPI is a Metric, But Not Every Metric is a KPI</h3><p>Just like John McEvoy quotes,” All tequilas are mezcals, but not all mezcals are tequilas.” (😉)</p><p>KPIs and metrics share the same relation.</p><p>For example, let's imagine that metrics are individual players that make up a soccer team, but the goalie is your KPI. These metrics make up the team and support your KPI.</p><p>In this example, the goalie (KPI) is tied to a specific objective despite being a player (metric) - that’s to protect his goal post at all times.</p><p>But you can't win if the other players (metrics) are not supporting your KPI.</p><p>Although there's a fine line of difference between KPIs and metrics, we have summarized the above points to get you everything at a glance.</p><img alt=""kpis vs metrics comparision chart"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/a8DZ8mqKbvqslVQ5ysMuQE4aFjE.png""><div><br></div><h2>Measurements vs Metrics: How Are They Different?</h2><p>Measurements and metrics are two interlinked scenes of the same movie; without seeing the one you won’t be able to understand the other.</p><p>Meaning, for a business to track any kind of progress, you need both measurement and metric. But are they the same?</p><p><strong>Short answer: </strong>No they’re not. ❌</p><p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p><p>A measure is a classification of raw data such as a number or a value which can be calculated using mathematical formulas.</p><p>For example, in marketing, sales, cost, and profits are measurements you do to get a vague estimation about any business.</p><p>On the other hand, the end result of metrics is also a number but it’s <strong>‘specific.’</strong> Metrics are quantifiable measurements used to measure business performance.</p><p>So the main difference between measurement and metric is, measurement gives you a vague number but metrics give you specific numbers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Typical examples of metrics: </strong>Increase in website traffic, decrease in bounce rate, etc.</p><h3>Using Measures and Metrics in Tandem 🤝</h3><p>Oftentime, to track business performance in any vertical, using measures and metrics in tandem is advisable. That’s because when you use them together you get<strong> ‘specific measurements’</strong> and not just measurements.</p><p>Here’s an example for you to understand it better:</p><p>Instead of just tracking sales (measurement), track sales of product A in July (measurement + metric).&nbsp;</p><p>Tracking both these elements is beneficial for investors, share holders, and even your team.</p><p>Imagine showing a dashboard to an investor that has just Total Sales - $400,000, the very next question they might ask you is where’s the monthly sales?&nbsp;</p><p>That’s where metrics come into the picture.&nbsp;</p><p>When you show your investors the month over month sales by combining measures and metrics, your investors are able to see the growth you’ve had over the months - a very crucial metric, when it comes to investment.</p><h2>KPIs vs Metrics Examples</h2><p>Now that you know the differences between KPI and metric, and understand why both are crucial for performance measurement. Let’s take an example to elaborate how they help in measuring specific objectives.</p><p>Suppose you're trying to achieve a big sales goal, let’s say increase sales by 25% in 12 weeks. This goal is relevant to various departments across your business, and each of these departments will track multiple metrics to measure how their activities contribute toward the goal.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's see how KPI and metrics are used here.</p><h3>KPI: Sales Growth</h3><img alt=""sales growth kpi example"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0eRN3PQYR7RmtZYFVsQduf6oR38.png""><p>The image above is a visual representation of the main KPI: sales growth.</p><p>Here, you can compare the sales made from the previous period with the current sales made by individual sales reps and the percentage increase in sales over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Although KPI can be used to measure sales growth, to drill down your analysis, you need to figure out how different activities fall in line with your ultimate goal. This can be done by measuring specific sales metrics.</p><h3>Metrics: Lead to Conversion Ratio</h3><img alt=""lead to conversion rate kpi"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Dfe9WgFWEubmx1i5GFc4E11g1P4.png""><p>In this case, the lead-to-conversion rate is an excellent metric to track. It measures the number of leads that turned into paying customers, thereby adding to sales growth.</p><p>The lead-to-conversion metric provides deeper insights into how and what amount of leads are converting into customers.</p><p>The metric also presents you with employee insights, such as what percentage of leads were converted into actual customers by an individual sales rep.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows you to get a broader perspective of who contributed more towards the main goal: sales growth.</p><p>Likewise, you can use metrics such as lead-to-opportunity ratio, net profit margin, monthly sales, and more of the same nature to drill down on the low-level performance that took place to accomplish a high-level goal.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-examples""><strong>KPI Examples: Here Are the Best 30 You Can Find in 2022</strong></a></p><div><br></div><h2>How Tracking KPIs and Metrics Can Help Businesses?</h2><p>Making online business decisions based on assumptions is no better than walking in a maze blindfolded. You're in no control of where you are heading, but you know you're heading somewhere. The same goes while tracking KPIs and metrics.</p><p>For the most part, tracking KPIs and metrics can help you stay in control of your business while allowing you to make better data-driven decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's how they help in a nutshell:</p><h3>#1. Monitor Company's Health</h3><p>While you might think of this as a time-consuming process, you just require a handful of KPIs to monitor your company's health, such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Financial KPIs:</strong> Measure and compare previous and present financial metrics to drive revenue growth</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Employee KPIs:</strong> Measure employee productivity and happiness to evaluate the company's working environment</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Customer Success KPIs: </strong>Measure how your services are doing for your customer and figure out ways to improve</p></li></ul><p>These KPIs fall under metrics such as customer retention rate, net profit margin, and more of the same nature. Moreover, they can easily gauge your business health over a given period.</p><h3>#2. Measure Progress</h3><p>Key performance indicators can immensely help you measure your business's progress towards pre-determined goals or objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>All you need to do is set the right KPIs and track critical metrics like Revenue, Gross margin, and compare past and present performances to measure progress.</p><p>Metrics give businesses in-depth insights into how well particular campaigns, strategies, and activities are performed. This helps managers identify areas where they need to make changes for better results.</p><h3>#3. Make Adjustments</h3><p>There might be times when a wrong decision can derail your business. However, tracking KPIs and performance metrics allows you to be in control of what's working for you and what's not.</p><p>Tracking KPIs and metrics such as leading and lagging indicators at certain intervals can help you identify pain points and determine the future course of action for the better growth of your business.</p><div><br></div><h2>Track Your KPI Metrics Easily to Stay on Top of Your Business</h2><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a modern-day KPI tracking software that allows anyone to collect, monitor, and analyze important business KPI metrics from their mobile phones.</p><img alt=""datapad kpi tracking tool"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/vkIbE1Tho8Eop0poSNBYgfvxhtg.png""><p>Unlike other KPI tracking software in the market, Datapad is highly-responsive and compatible with all known devices and integrates with the likes of Google Analytics, Google Sheets, Facebook Ads, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>That means it helps you to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Track all your KPIs from your mobile phones</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Effectively communicate and collaborate with your team&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Automatically import data from multiple data sources</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Measure your business performance from anywhere</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Monitor change in KPIs and metrics in real-time</p></li></ul><p>The best part is, Datapad is in its beta testing phase and you can <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/join-waitlist"">join the waitlist</a> to try it for free today.</p><p>So what are you waiting for, get your marketing team onboard and start measuring KPIs and metrics on the go!</p><p><strong>Recommended reading: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/google-sheets-dashboard""><strong>How to Make Google Sheets Dashboard in 3 Steps [2022]</strong></a></p><p><strong>Recommended reading: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/google-sheets-dashboard-templates""><strong>Best 16 Free Google Sheets Dashboard Templates [2022]</strong></a></p><p><strong>Recommended reading: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-okrs""><strong>KPIs vs. OKRs: What is the Difference and How to Use Both Correctly</strong></a></p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p>"

Today OKRs are used by the likes of Google, LinkedIn, and Netflix to improve business performances.&nbsp;</p><p>OKR is a basket term consisting of two parts - <strong>Objectives</strong> and <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Results</strong>.</p><p>An objective is<em><strong> ‘what’</strong></em> you want to do. It describes the inspirational goals of an individual, company, or team that need to be achieved over a short time.</p><p>Key results, on the other hand, answer the <em><strong>‘how’</strong></em> part. These are the measurable and verifiable methods to reach the objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, you can think of objectives as the final destination you want to reach,&nbsp; whereas key results are like signboards that ensure you’re on the right path.&nbsp;</p><p>OKRs are simple yet powerful goal-setting methodologies used by companies and teams to achieve ambitious goals through a framework of constant evaluation.&nbsp;</p><p>However, what makes OKRs even more beneficial is the clarity to teams and corporations to execute their strategy with focus and alignment.</p><p>So, if you’re wondering why you should use OKRs, here’s the answer to it:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Focus</strong>: By focusing on a few top-line objectives, a company can remain focused on a handful of initiatives that make a meaningful difference</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Aligning day-to-day activities linked to the top objectives helps to achieve the company’s vision</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Commitments: </strong>Commitments are transparent signals that result in motivation and ensure everyone is working towards the objectives</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Tracking: </strong>OKR enables teams and organizations to measure the progress toward a specific goal</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Stretching Goals: </strong>OKRs allow the team to stretch goals that inherently push the organization to strive further than the usual</p></li></ul><h3>OKR Examples</h3><p>To understand better, let’s look at some examples of OKRs.</p><h4>#1. HR OKR</h4><h5>Objective</h5><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Hire 20 employees by the end of Q3</p></li></ul><h5>Key Results</h5><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Receive 100 resumes next month</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Interview 70 shortlisted candidates&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Onboard 20 candidates</p></li></ul><h4>#2.

Here are a few examples of commonly used KPIs by different businesses:</p><h4>#1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h4><p>Customer acquisition cost measures the cost of acquiring a new customer.</p><p>For example, if a company spends $5,000 in a month on sales and marketing and acquires 100 new customers:</p><p>Then, CAC is $5000 / 100 = $50.</p><h4>#2. Net Profit Margin</h4><p>Net profit margin shows the profitability of a business per dollar spent. Understanding this KPI promotes better decision-making and keeps you ahead of your competitors in pricing wars.</p><p>NPM is an important cash flow component and can be measured by subtracting total expenses from total revenue.</p><p><strong>Net Profit </strong>= Total revenue - Total expense</p><h4>#3. Return on Investment</h4><p>ROI is like a mirror to your investment. It lets you evaluate how well an investment has performed over a certain time.</p><p><strong>ROI </strong>= (Net income / Cost of Investment) X 100</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-examples""><strong>KPI Examples: Here Are the Best 30 You Can Find in 2022</strong></a></p><div><br></div><h2>OKRs vs KPIs - What’s the Difference?</h2><h3>#1.

At the same time, OKR is an effective goal-setting framework that uses defined key results to track the success of a set objective or goal.</p><h3>#2. Purpose</h3><p>KPIs are progress indicators that determine how near or far you’re from achieving your goals. It’s a performance management tool that helps in making data-driven decisions.</p><p>OKRs, on the other hand, have nothing to do with tracking. It's a simple method organizations use to set smart goals that a company wants to achieve.</p><p>Moreover, it encourages engagement among team members by keeping them aligned to a specific target.</p><h3>#3. Timeline</h3><p>The primary difference between the approach of OKRs and KPIs is the span of vision.&nbsp;</p><p>OKRs are qualitative yet measurable goals that are further broken into several key results adjusted within a timeline.</p><p>&nbsp;KPIs can be set for extended periods, and they are not bound by any timeline. If the linked objective is changed or the KPI doesn't seem to be the right fit, it can be dropped.</p><h3>#4. Structure</h3><p>OKRs consist of two parts, objectives and key results. Each objective has defined key results that determine how to attain that objective.</p><p>KPIs include specific indicators to measure the growth of an organization or a team towards an intended result.</p><h3>#5. Goals</h3><p>OKR usually boasts a more ambitious goal for the teams to push beyond their defined limits. On the contrary, KPIs include growth measurements that are quite attainable and realistic.</p><img alt=""KPIs vs OKRs comparison table"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/frFBoHwRQFY1lf17hQTy5YN2uA.png""><div><br></div><h2>How to Set OKRs and KPIs?</h2><p>Now that you’re aware of the basics of OKRs and KPIs and the difference between them, you might be wondering about some best tips to set OKRs and KPIs.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't worry; we've got you covered.</p><h3>How to Set OKRs</h3><h4>#1. Measure What Matters</h4><p>To solve a problem, first, you need to identify where it lies.&nbsp;</p><p>Identifying the areas of business that need the most improvement is the first step to setting OKRs. Looking at your KPIs may reveal those areas with certain problems needed to be solved.&nbsp;</p><p>This results in a more focused approach and increases the chance of success.</p><p>For instance, if customer satisfaction is lower than expected, the objective will be to improve it.</p><p>And key results will be:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Talk to users about the product interface&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Improve customer satisfaction by at least 30%</p></li></ul><h4>#2. Set Clear Goals</h4><p>Don't set goals that are too vague. Goals like <strong>'More growth'</strong> or <strong>'Increase revenue'</strong> will not help you achieve anything.</p><p>Set clear and quantifiable goals like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Bring down CAC from $50 to $30 till next quarter</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increase revenue by 30% till the end of November</p></li></ul><p>Use numbers and percentages so that you can measure them easily.&nbsp;</p><h4>#3. Collaboration</h4><p>Teamwork is always encouraged while setting the right OKRs. Taking inputs from teams and individuals while defining the objective and key results is necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Allow your team members to have a flexible opinion about the objectives and incorporate their vision in reaching them.&nbsp;</p><p>This way, you will receive numerous ideas to refine OKRs and achieve them with the best possible strategy.</p><h4>#4. Track Progress</h4><p>It’s advised to track the progress of your team within a timeline. This gives you an update about the company’s growth and how much work has to be done to achieve specific goals.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> It doesn’t matter if you don’t hit a home run every time. Every step you take towards the goal demands a little celebration. Celebrate small wins, they will prepare you for bigger ones.</p><h4>#5. Timing</h4><p>Lastly, knowing when to readjust your OKRs is an important step. When business priorities change, you should align your objectives with the new vision.</p><p>It's better to have a flexible approach with the goals when the situation demands change rather than chasing something that ends in frustration.</p><h3>How to Set KPIs</h3><p>KPIs can be best explained by taking an example of a car. 🚘</p><p>Imagining your business is a car, and KPIs are the headlights.&nbsp;</p><p>However, without specific targets, they are worthless.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are 5 simple steps to guide you to set the best KPIs for your teams and organizations:</p><h4>#1. Make Sure Your Goals are Quantifiable</h4><p>Most businesses are in a rush to track KPIs. But before setting them up, you must list your company's measurable goals.&nbsp;</p><p>This means your goals must be clear enough so that you can visualize them.&nbsp;</p><p>So, before setting KPIs, you might want to first check that your goals are measurable and not some abstract targets you have in mind.&nbsp;</p><h4>#2. Define Clear Objectives for KPIs</h4><p>Before thinking about setting the KPIs, you need to have a solid understanding of your business objectives. Make sure these objectives are authentic and have the potential to drive meaning to your business.</p><p>Otherwise, your business will be like a ship in a violent ocean with nowhere to go. Moreover, you will also end up losing your resources with almost zero outcomes.</p><p><strong>❌Never Do This:</strong> Without knowing your business well, don’t start measuring random indicators you got by spying on your competitors.&nbsp;</p><h4>#3. Decide the Number of KPIs You Want to Track</h4><p>Once you have defined the relevant KPIs, it’s time to decide how many of them you should track. You can begin with choosing your priority goals and building KPIs around them.</p><p>This helps you to focus on what’s most important and eliminate the rest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Don’t try to link too many KPIs to a single objective. It increases the chance of leaving out the most important areas which need attention.</p><h4>#4. Ensure You Can Communicate</h4><p>After you have decided to set KPIs, ensure you can provide context to the stakeholders and employees about those KPIs.</p><p>Your employees must understand why and which KPIs you track.&nbsp;</p><p>That way, you can gather valuable inputs from them that can help revamp your approach toward choosing more efficient KPIs.</p><h4>#5. Review KPIs Frequently</h4><p>Make sure to document the progress of the KPIs so that you know what’s working and what’s not. If found irrelevant, scrap and adjust them in accordance with the new set goals.</p><div><br></div><h2>When to Use OKRs and KPIs?</h2><h3>When to Use OKRs</h3><p>OKRs help an organization when they have a clear target in mind. That’s because these help you come up with well-defined key results as to how you’re going to achieve those targets.</p><p>Look at the OKR below:</p><h4>Objective</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increase the profitability of your e-commerce business by 20%</p></li></ul><h4>Key Results</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Boost customer retention by 40%</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Reduce advertising costs by 20%</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increase customer survey from 10 per day to 50</p></li></ul><p>Such scenarios demand you to build OKRs and act on them.</p><h3>When to Use KPIs</h3><p>KPIs are decision-making metrics that boost your business to the next level. However, if you try to measure something that is not clear and quantifiable, you can be easily lost.</p><p>So, to have effective results, first, clarify your goals.</p><p>Take the HR department, for example.</p><p>Suppose the HR department wants to track the average cost to fill one role. Clearly, it’s a specific and measurable goal. That makes it easier to track.</p><p>They can calculate it by dividing total recruitment costs by the number of hires.</p><p>But if the department wants to check the quality of those hires, KPIs won’t be of any use as the goal is not specific.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be arguments about what a quality hire consists of, which makes the goal hazy and impossible to track via KPI.</p><h2>Track Your KPIs with Datapad&nbsp;</h2><p>Datapad is a mobile-first tool built for Android and iOS devices that helps business owners track KPIs on the go.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1iD1mpclopyNrRBi50ka9EBKOHk.gif""><p>You can set up a dashboard with Datapad in seconds, add KPIs to it, and bring your sales and marketing team on board to track them.</p><p>Being a mobile-friendly app, you can track KPIs from a beach, hill, or anywhere in the world.

Analyzing marketing KPIs help you track, optimize, and predict marketing campaign performance.</p><p>In this article, you will discover the 11 best marketing KPIs to track and analyze for your business, no matter the sector you’re in.</p><p>So all I’ve to say is..</p><img alt=""gif american Im only starting"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Fzd8uRlN5eiDz6UxuFuVfGAlnc.gif""><h2>What Are Marketing KPIs?</h2><p>KPIs in marketing are quantifiable measurements used by marketing teams to gauge their performance over marketing activities.&nbsp;</p><p>Like any other business activity, leaders want to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns every now and then.</p><p>And to help them do so, <strong>KPIs in marketing</strong> prove the ROI of marketing strategies, allowing businesses to double down on what works.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, you can think of marketing KPIs as the mountain peak⛰ and marketing efforts as the hikers🧗 trying to conquer it. If your marketing team sets a KPI to increase website traffic by 40% in the next 5 months, your goals and activities will be outlined around achieving this KPI.</p><p>So, now that you understand what <strong>KPIs for marketing</strong> means, let's learn more about how it benefits marketing teams.</p><h2>What Are the Benefits of Tracking Marketing KPIs?</h2><h3>#1. They Help You Supercharge Your Marketing ROI ⚡</h3><p>You can improve anything that can be measured. The same goes for your returns from marketing efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>When tracked and measured correctly, certain key performance indicators for marketing can result in a high return on investment.</p><p>For example, 5:1 is considered <a href=""https://www.marketingevolution.com/marketing-essentials/marketing-roi"">a good marketing ROI</a>. Earning $5 on every $ 1 spent on marketing or, in some cases, earning $10 by spending $1 on marketing (10:1) are amusing benchmarks.</p><p>And since you have predetermined benchmarks, you can use these metrics to get a better idea about which activities and campaigns have contributed directly to the bottom line.</p><p>Eventually, repurposing activities that result in the greatest ROI.</p><h3>#2. They Justify Your Spends 💸</h3><p>Marketing activities roughly comprise 13.8% of the company's total budget.</p><img alt=""marketing expenses chart"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/HmVcEb57umjuNOGv0HkxzELuI.png""><p><a href=""https://cmosurvey.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The_CMO_Survey-Highlights_and_Insights_Report-September_2022.pdf"">Source</a></p><p>Really? Just 13.8%? That doesn't sound like something to worry about!</p><p>But the thing is, with every passing year, the marketing budgets are significantly increasing. And we discovered three major reasons behind it:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Economic Inflations: </strong>Causing a high rise in the cost of literally everything</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Customer Expectation:</strong> Soaring day after day</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Competitive Market:</strong> You need to beat the competition anyways</p></li></ul><p>However, most marketers fail to justify the increase in budgets to stakeholders and investors. Even though they are pumping money for marketing campaigns, they can't justify spending due to lower or negative ROI.</p><p>Some of the top marketing KPIs like cost per lead, customer satisfaction rate, CPC, and more help you understand what all marketing tactics are worth investing in.&nbsp;</p><h3>#3. They Give a Competitive Advantage 🎖️</h3><p>As we stated earlier, around 89% of marketers use marketing metrics for strategic decision-making. However, their choice of metrics depends upon their business type, budget, resources, and goals.</p><p>So it's possible that the metrics you are tracking aren't similar to the ones your competitors are tracking and the other way around.</p><p>If you find the right balance of metrics and KPIs, you can gather enough data to get the upper hand over the competition. Data such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customers Personas</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Habits and behaviors</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Channels with an impressive ROI</p></li></ul><p>And more…&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, you can use these insights to create better, personalized marketing campaigns.</p><h3>#4. They Prevent You From Guesswork 🤔</h3><p>Guess is a debatable term.</p><p>While it might work well for gamblers, it certainly puts you on the edge when it comes to running a business. Here, it would be best to have actionable insights rather than trial-and-error methods.</p><p>And KPIs for marketing help you gather that data and present them in a centralized manner, adding meaning to it. In fact, <a href=""https://www.adverity.com/data-driven-marketing"">2 out of 3</a> marketers admit that data-driven decisions beat gut intent.</p><h3>#5. They Help You Grow Faster 🏎️</h3><p>Measurement is all about improvement!</p><p>When you have a competitive advantage, a better return on investment, and data-driven insights, you will grow faster than you would otherwise.</p><p>Moreover, your business growth will be much faster when you track the most important metrics and use the information to your advantage.</p><p>Let's review some of the marketing KPIs examples that can help you grow 10X faster.</p><h2>What Are the 11 Best Marketing KPIs to Track?</h2><h3>#1. Organic Traffic</h3><p>Organic traffic is the number of visitors you receive on your website from unpaid channels or sources (mostly from organic search results).</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Organic traffic is important because it helps the site attract visitors and increase its popularity without paying a dime for ads.</p><p>Simply put, the higher you rank, the more traffic you generate organically. Listed below are some of the best practices to improve your organic traffic:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Target keywords that match intent (even if they're low or zero-volume keywords)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Consistently put content on your website or optimize your old content for SEO</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Focus on adding quality backlinks to your website</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Gor-for long-tail keywords (suggested by marketers)</p></li></ul><p>The best way to measure organic traffic is via Google Analytics.</p><p>To do so, open Google Analytics and click<strong> All Traffic</strong>, then <strong>Channels</strong>. Here, you'll find the different traffic sources, including organic traffic.</p><h3>#2. Customer Acquisition Cost</h3><p>Customer acquisition cost is one of the <strong>top marketing KPIs</strong> that measure the total cost incurred on acquiring a new customer. It typically includes the total sales and marketing cost required to earn a new customer over a specific period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>CAC directly impacts your marketing budgets, and therefore executives keep an eye on this metric so it doesn't get out of control.</p><p><strong>Think About It:</strong> No rational company would spend $500 to acquire a new customer with an expected Lifetime Value (LTV) of $300 because it wouldn’t just make sense in the long run.</p><p>Although CAC differs from company to company, a typical SaaS company usually has an average acquisition cost of <a href=""https://hockeystack.com/blog/average-customer-acquisition-cost-by-industry/"">$205</a>. However, the lower, the better.</p><p>Reducing CAC means that the business is spending money more efficiently and should see higher returns in its total profit.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate CAC:</p><img alt=""cac formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lNZ0ziI1roWI8za73dCjlH12Vv4.jpeg""><h3>#3. Customer Lifetime Value</h3><p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) measures the amount of money a business expects to generate from its customers during their relationship with the company.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This metric is tied with other marketing KPIs, such as CAC and churn rate, to make it more insightful. Although it's a predictive metric, it can help you by miles when measuring your marketing performance.</p><p>You see, if a customer's lifetime value (CLV) is lower than his acquisition cost, you're not making any profits since the cost of acquiring these customers is more than what they are spending on your business.</p><p>Likewise, CLV is a great metric to use when you have a multi-year relationship with a customer – say, for a paid monthly subscription. And it's good for spotting the early signs of attrition to implement spot-on retention strategies.</p><p>To measure customer lifetime value, you first need to determine your ideal customer value. Here's how you can find both:</p><img alt=""clv formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/zgTLnEoa1Je8gijUUjiDvPPfuU.png""><h3>#4. Customer Retention Rate&nbsp;</h3><p>Customer retention rate measures the percentage of customers that return to do business with you during a given time frame.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Factually, <a href=""https://www.crmnext.com/resource/customer-retention-statistics"">65% of a company's business</a> comes from existing customers. That's why you often see businesses running loyalty programs, giving out freebies, and offering mind-boggling discounts.</p><p>In fact, a 5% increase in retention rate leads to an impressive 25-95% increase in profits.</p><p>You can easily see the incredible difference a minor retention effort can make. Besides, acquiring new customers cost businesses 5X more than retaining customers.&nbsp;</p><p>And therefore, tracking and measuring this KPI on a regular basis is important for business owners and marketers.</p><p>A retention rate of 25% or higher is considered good for marketing teams.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the retention rate:</p><img alt=""CRR formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PrRdjV4bsVIgCW9lvwoFMHHATY.jpeg""><p>Where,</p><p>E = Customer at the end of the period</p><p>N = Customers acquired during the period</p><p>S = Customers you have at the start of the period</p><h3>#5. ROI on Marketing&nbsp;</h3><p>ROI on marketing stands among the most used KPIs in marketing. It's actually the key metrics investors and stakeholders look forward to when analyzing the company's marketing performance.</p><p>We can define it as a KPI that quantifies to justify your returns on money spent on running marketing programs and campaigns.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Earlier, we stated two significant benefits of <strong>KPIs in marketing</strong>:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>It supercharges your return on marketing investment</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>It accounts for your marketing expenses</p></li></ul><p>This metric somewhat gives both benefits to your marketing team. It's a prolific indicator of how well you use your funds to direct revenue gains.</p><p>If your investments in certain marketing campaigns are not yielding results, you might want to change your approach before you go bankrupt.</p><p>Here’s how you calculate ROI for marketing:</p><img alt=""marketing roi formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/M3269yJafr5CrX30Z9gj8OmI5Fw.png""><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>An ROI of 5:1 ($5 earned on every dollar spent) is considered good, but anything beyond that is exceptional as a marketer.</p><h3>#6. Net Promoter Score [NPS]</h3><p>Marketers use Net Promoter Score (NPS) to measure the percentage of customers that are likely to recommend your product or service to their friends.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>NPS is a customer-centric metric, i.e., it allows marketing teams to keep an eye on their customers' experience and sentiments toward the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, NPS can be used as an indicator of business growth. A high NPS indicates a healthy relationship with customers who are likely to act as amplifiers for the brand, fuel word of mouth, and generate a positive growth cycle.</p><p>NPS is generally measured by sending a single survey question having a scale from 0 to 10. Here, '0' being the least happy someone is to recommend your product, and '10' is the other way around.</p><p>To ease things, we classify the voters into three categories:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Promoters:</strong> People who vote between 7 to 10 (highly likely to recommend your product)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Neutral:</strong> People who vote 4 to 6 (not sure of recommending your product)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Detractors:</strong> People who vote below 4 (probably didn't have a nice customer experience)</p></li></ul><p>And once you have the numbers, calculating NPS is pretty simple:</p><img alt=""NPS formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/sy8ocVaKX58xY5ecv4yas4D9ww.jpeg""><h3>#7. Conversion Rate</h3><p>Conversion rate measures the percentage of website visitors who completed a desired action. The action can be anything from clicking on a link to subscribing to your newsletter.&nbsp;</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Tracking your conversion rate is essential to understand how your sales funnel is performing and what marketing campaign has the greatest repercussions on your company's ROI.</p><p>Think about it like this. You're running a marketing campaign to get registrations for a webinar. Tracking conversion rate is a great way to tell what percentage of visitors actually come up to your landing page after watching your ads or social posts.</p><p>Conversion rate can also drill down insights on what percentage of people see your ad, visit your landing page, but don't register for your webinar. Thereby highlighting some issues that might have set off potential leads, such as,</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Poor landing page copy</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Unattractive page layout and design</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Targeting the wrong audience</p></li></ul><p>Here's a quick formula to calculate the conversion rate:</p><img alt=""conversion rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/iz2Hz7vsUGUPERG9aUi4r71S87A.png""><h3>#8. Traffic to MQL Ratio</h3><p>This marketing KPI measures the portion of website traffic that has been reviewed by the marketing team and satisfies all criteria of being a potential customer for the business.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Generally, visitors become leads when they share some kind of information with brands, such as sharing their email address or contact information.&nbsp;</p><p>Those leads become marketing qualified leads (MQLs) when they're determined to be in the company's target market and match one of its buyer personas.&nbsp;</p><p>This ratio is important because it reflects the effectiveness of each of your marketing channels whether they're worth their cost.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate it:</p><img alt=""Traffic MQL Ratio Formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XLnfBjx9Ck06eokW0pHJLhaV4.png""><p>To calculate the percentage, simply divide the resultant by 100.</p><h3>#9. Churn Rate</h3><p>The churn rate measures the rate at which customers stop doing business with your company during a given period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>When looking at hundreds of different SaaS companies, we've discovered that there's a wealth of complexity when measuring churn rate. It might be due to complex pricing models or complexity in calculating the frequent number of customers coming in and moving out.</p><p>Whatever it is, this KPI streamlines the whole process and helps you clearly identify the rate at which your business is losing customers.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the churn rate:</p><img alt=""Customer Churn rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/3yBX7YbFhwWuQH3oHoZFp1s3wfc.png""><h3>#10. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)</h3><p>Return on Advertising Spend is a marketing KPI focusing on the gains made over money spent on paid marketing campaigns.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>ROAS typically measures the efficiency of a digital advertising campaign. It helps online businesses evaluate which methods work and how they can improve future advertising efforts.</p><p>So how can you calculate it? Here's a quick formula:</p><img alt=""ROAS formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/mohT62OrbIzg9ztCD6XDKyT8llk.png""><h3>#11. Bounce Rate</h3><p>Bounce rate measures the percentage of visitors who leave your website without taking any action.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Bounce rate is an excellent way to analyze how website visitors engage with your content. After all, you want your visitors to land on your page and do something.</p><p>But if they don't, it could be due to many reasons, such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Irrelevant content</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Slow loading time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Poor navigation</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Un-interactive design</p></li></ul><p>Tracking this KPI can help you drill down at what stage of the customer journey they chose to exit your website. This can help you improve your bits that might be waving off visitors.</p><p>Besides, bounce rates are a leading factor in determining your website's authority to search engines. You see, a higher bounce rate indicates that visitors are not interacting with your website. Thus search engines won't show it in the first place.</p><p>Most websites' average bounce rate is between <a href=""https://www.gorocketfuel.com/the-rocket-blog/whats-the-average-bounce-rate-in-google-analytics/"">26% and 70%</a>.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate your website's bounce rate:</p><img alt=""Bounce rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pz9YEOCDH8RdprpahQBeqdII0w.png""><p>Here are some secondary KPIs that didn’t make the cut but are still essential:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Social Media KPIs: </strong>Likes, engagement, comments on social media</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Number of Leads: </strong>Audience your convert into leads per month</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Content Marketing KPIs: </strong>How your content is performing on website and social media</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Email Marketing KPIs:</strong> If you run an email campaign, how’s it doing</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Click-Through Rate (CTR): </strong>Click through rate rate especially on ad campaigns</p></li></ul><h2>How to Track Marketing KPIs with Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad kpi tracker homepage "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/96iexZuC9g7Ra7ijtzCvspdUqpU.png""><p>Datapad is a mobile-only KPI tracking and dashboarding tool that allows anyone to collect, measure, and analyze marketing data via interactive and beautiful dashboards.</p><p>It's a complete no-code platform and can be easily accessed and used by your marketing teams without any technical jargon.

Team Collaboration</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lfMtGJd62Mic0PYHmbTCMfmPDNY.png""><p>Tracking KPIs isn't a one-person job when you have a lot of them; you need a team. But not all KPI dashboard tools let you bring your team on board.&nbsp;</p><p>Guess what? Datapad lets you do it quickly and easily.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, you can assign individual team members tasks to handle, goals to achieve, and metrics to measure.</p><p>With Datapad's team collaboration feature, you can:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get notified whenever there’s an update for any metrics and KPIs you track</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Communicate around your metrics and KPIs with your team members</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get push notifications on your phone to stay updated with all your KPIs</p></li></ul><h3>Key Feature #3.

If You Want to Do a Deep Analysis and Not Have a Quick Overview of Your Data</h4><p>Datapad is meant for founders and managers who just want to keep an eye on all the KPIs and not dig further. In case there’s something off, they can ask their team to take care of it. </p><p>If you’re an individual tracking all the KPIs in-depth and want to know why each KPI is performing the way it is, we’d suggest you go ahead with Metabase or some other KPI dashboarding tool. </p><p>But if you just want a managerial view of your KPIs fast and frequently, Datapad will prove to be a great choice.</p><h4>#2. You Don't Want to Have a Mobile-Only Experience </h4><p>If you're a desktop-ridden person, our tool isn't the right choice. Our tool does not support desktop dashboarding (it's something being worked upon). Besides, Datapad has an amazing mobile version that has all the features you expect from a desktop-dashboarding tool.</p><h4>#3. You Need a Lot of Integrations</h4><p>We’re being honest here! If you are the owner of a large organization or someone who needs tons of integrations to extract data from multiple data points, Datapad will limit your needs. </p><p>Although we are consistently working on adding more and more integrations to our platform, as of now, it’s limited to some popular integrations.</p><p>Maybe down the line, Datapad would be an excellent choice for sourcing data from multiple data sources, but for now, it isn't.</p><h3>Pros and Cons</h3><h4>Pros</h4><p>✅ Has a dedicated mobile app</p><p>✅ Supports real-time collaboration</p><p>✅ A no-code platform; even beginners can learn how to use it in minutes</p><h4>Cons</h4><p>❌ No desktop version (coming soon)</p><p>❌ Has selective integrations</p><h2>#2.

They're panicking as one of your business KPIs is acting all strange and your team has no idea what to do! 😳</p><p>What do you do?</p><p>Will you just book the next flight home and get there to resolve the issue?</p><p>Nah!</p><p>Instead, have a mobile app to track your KPIs so you can observe, analyze, and communicate to your teammates how to tackle the situation while sitting on a beach.</p><p>This way you still get to enjoy the chilled beer by the beach while your team resolves the issue as you suggest to them and keep you in the loop. 😉&nbsp;</p><p>All this because you have a mobile dashboard to track KPIs right away!</p><p>In this article, you'll discover what mobile dashboards are, their benefits, and how to track KPIs via mobile dashboards using our app Datapad.</p><h2>What is a Mobile Dashboard?</h2><p>A mobile dashboard is a data analytics tool that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics on mobile.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an insightful console that provides access to all the KPIs related to your business from several data sources at your fingertips so that you can make educated business decisions on the go.</p><p>Let’s show you an example to understand better.</p><p>With the mobile dashboards, you can get real-time data about your car's security if you have integrated the GPS into your mobile.&nbsp;</p><p>The GPS dashboard provides remote access to your car’s speed, the last location, stoppage time, and many more things to keep you updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Components of Mobile Dashboard</h3><p>Here are some components that go into the making of a mobile dashboard:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Data Sources:</strong> The data source could be a database, file, or live data feed. Consider an example of an e-commerce website. To display the information on the products, the website gets information from the inventory database. That makes the inventory database a source of data.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Data Visualization Elements: </strong>Data visualization is a visual representation of data in simple charts, graphs, and maps. It's a unique combination of art and science that assist the users in discovering patterns that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Filters: </strong>Filters are a crucial part of mobile dashboards. It helps to narrow down the results so that the end user can focus on the most important metrics. For example, applying a gender-specific filter to a dashboard that covers population data will only display the male or female population on the same dashboard.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>KPI: </strong>Key performance indicators are the quantifiable metrics that identify and gauge the success of an organization against its business objectives. KPIs provide targets and insights that help organizations foster continual growth.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Dashboard Menu:</strong> Dashboard menu allows you to create, save and open new dashboards. You can invoke all the other dashboard settings by clicking on the dashboard menu option.</p></li></ul><p>Now that you know what the components of a mobile dashboard are, let's look at why they're comparatively comfortable in tracking KPIs.</p><h3>How Are Mobile Dashboards Better than Desktop Dashboards?</h3><p>There are two key differences between mobile dashboards and dashboards specially built for desktops. Let's have a look at them.</p><h4>#1. Mobile Dashboard Designs Are Superior than Desktop's</h4><p>The desktop has relatively more screen real estate than a mobile. Sometimes, that could tempt the dashboard designer to overwhelm it with information, which could be hard on the eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, due to its limited screen size, a mobile dashboard only contains key outliers and the most important KPIs. This way, it's easier for mobile users to scan through the vital data and act on it immediately.</p><h4>#2. Ease of Access</h4><p>A robust mobile dashboard can amplify your business by providing interactively remote access to high-level KPIs. But the desktop dashboard demands a wired connection to display data, limiting the data accessibility reach.</p><p>Although we compared the two dashboards (mobile and desktop) to find the better one, if you want the best of both worlds, ensure that both the platforms are in tandem with one another.</p><p>Anyways, let’s talk a little bit more about mobile dashboards.</p><p>Just smashing random KPIs on a mobile dashboard won’t do the job. There are some tips and tricks to follow that’d help you track KPIs better.</p><p>Let’s see what those are!</p><h2>Best Practices to Follow While Building Mobile Dashboards</h2><p>There are three things to take care of while designing a mobile business dashboard:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Easy to read&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Intuitive design&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Contains only the most relevant information</p></li></ul><p>To make this a process of success so that you and your team actually find what you're looking for, you need to follow certain design practices that include:</p><h3>#1. Responsive Design</h3><p>Selecting a mobile tracking KPI software with a responsive <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/dashboard-design"">dashboard design</a> is crucial.&nbsp;</p><p>Responsive designs enable the dashboards to resize the screen according to various devices like smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches.&nbsp;</p><p>It allows the user to control which data needs to be in the limelight and what KPIs can be seen later after scrolling..</p><h3>#2. Less of a Mess</h3><p>Select a mobile KPI dashboard software that lets you make the best use of your mobile phone screens.</p><p>Having a simple and intuitive designed dashboard that has minimum clutter gives you easy access to dashboard elements.&nbsp;</p><p>This increases the overall productivity as it allows you and the team members to focus on key metrics.</p><h3>#3. Wise Use of Filters</h3><p>Filters help to narrow down the results so that you can focus on what you decide to do.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we highly recommend avoiding an app that uses multiple filters on mobile screens.&nbsp;</p><p>Select the one that has minimum filters on mobile devices. This stops the screen from getting cluttered and enhances the overall user experience.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Use of multiple filters on a mobile device can drain your mobile battery and slow down the KPI tracking by slowing down the load speed.</p><h3>#4. Consistency</h3><p>It can be confusing for you to look at varying user interfaces and layouts of a business dashboard. Thus, being consistent with the design and layouts is deemed as one of the best practices when designing the elements of a mobile dashboard.</p><h3>#5. First Things First</h3><p>Overdoing the dashboard with too many flashy graphs and data points will create unnecessary confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid such situations, try having the most important KPIs on the top of your screen. You should have a proper understanding of how to prioritize your KPIs for different teams in your department.</p><p>Doing so enables a simplified view of the dashboard elements, which results in faster and more accurate decision-making.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If you have a bunch of KPIs and no other option but to track them all via a single dashboard. Keep the KPIs that you track quarterly and yearly below the ones you track daily or monthly. This way you won’t find yourself scrolling frequently.</p><h2>What are the Benefits When You View Dashboards on Mobile?</h2><p>As we saw, the mobile dashboard can take your business to higher levels by offering several pivotal insights in an interactive manner.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, you can access your data from anywhere you want, which alone makes it an incredible plus point for businesses to invest in.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait, there’s more!</p><p>Now it’s time we delve deeper into some real-time benefits of a mobile dashboard.</p><h3>#1. Real-Time Access</h3><p>Traditional dashboard design demands a hard-wired connection to provide access to data. This limits the users from getting real-time developments on data points which in turn results in ineffective business decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>When you start tracking KPIs on mobile, you can immediately access the desired data from anywhere you want.&nbsp;</p><p>This broadens the limits of data accessibility which helps you and your team to track and act on KPIs from anywhere in the world.</p><h3>#2. Accurate Decision Making</h3><p>By providing real-time information into a mobile dashboard, it's easier to extrapolate and make sense of trends, promoting swift and accurate decisions. This leads to more productive results and enhances the overall business operation.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, imagine a law firm hiring legal associates.&nbsp;</p><p>The executive of the company may use a real-time mobile dashboard that provides the individual with a comparative view of different parameters like competence, legal internship scores, etc, needed to judge the best among the pool of associates.&nbsp;</p><p>This can speed up the decision-making process as there’s enough data to come to a conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>#3. Innovative Business Models</h3><p>As mobile dashboards provide instant access to powerful analytics almost anywhere, organizations will likely incorporate it into their strategic planning to create innovative business models.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, by integrating a mobile app portfolio into their business model, a bakery company easily accesses real-time information on what its hot selling products are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>#4. Sharing</h3><p>As employees get to easily analyze and communicate vital business metrics in a flexible manner, it allows them to make more informed decisions than before. This way, a mobile dashboard contributes to the accelerated growth and evolution of an organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Mobile App Dashboard Examples</h2><p>With Datapad, creating mobile app dashboards just takes minutes. You can create them manually by plugging in metrics yourself, or you can connect a data source and let Datapad create a beautiful dashboard for you.</p><p>Let’s show you some examples of what dashboards we use to track our company’s progress with Datapad.</p><h3>#1.

Plecto is Expensive</h3><p>Let’s talk about Plecto’s pricing for a moment. Plecto has 3 paid plans.</p><p>The first is its Medium plan, priced at $250/month. This is for 10 licenses. If we compare this with its competitors, they charge half of this for 10 users (some even less) with more or less the same features.</p><p>And its second paid plan is Large for $390 per month for 10 users.</p><p>The third plan is Enterprise, for which you will have to contact their sales department.</p><p>Our point here is that spending so much on a KPI dashboard tool is only a good decision when you know this will make your business a fortune; otherwise, it's money down the drain.</p><p>When prices are so high, people will obviously expect more from the tool, and as a result, Plecto has got many reviews with complaints of high price. Here’s one such from <a href=""https://www.capterra.com/"">Capterra</a>.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/q4nSIK4QipsX4HmdFxpmsI0TM.png""><h3>Reason #2. Doesn’t Have Several Customization Features</h3><p>A KPI dashboard tool without premium customization options is a waste.&nbsp;</p><p>It might sound a bit harsh, but that's the bitter truth. If you want to track KPIs in-depth, you should be able to customize each and every aspect of your dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Plecto has some decent customization options like creating charts, filters, etc. but you can’t customize everything. And that’s where the customers aren’t satisfied with the tool.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/DJfSEBvtQOpdzscbrngUf7tYF3w.png""><h3>Reason #3. No Real-Time Google Analytics Integration</h3><p>So the tool portrays itself as a real-time Google Analytics integration, but that’s not really true.&nbsp;</p><p>The tool isn’t capable of pulling out real-time data from Google Analytics. It takes 30 minutes to an hour for it to refresh.&nbsp;</p><p>This can prove to be a serious issue whose business depends on day-to-day traffic.</p><p>Now that you know some prominent reasons for switching from Plecto to other KPI dashboard software, here’s a list of alternatives you can try out.</p><h2>11 Best Plecto Alternatives You Must Try</h2><h2>#1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> helps you track all essential <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">metrics </a>from stunning dashboards.</p><p>The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use.

Limited Integrations</h3><p>Polymer lacks key integrations, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Instagram, Twitter Ads, and Stripe. It also doesn’t integrate with some data connectors for free. For example, adding Shopify as a data source is billed separately at $3 per month per store.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/MoLnl60BXMdmMZSPfuKDs0uB9JU.png""><h3>Reason 2. Not a Team Analytics Platform</h3><p>Polymer isn't ideal for teams. Although it allows adding collaborators, I can't annotate something or communicate with my team while staying on the dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>If I have to give suggestions on a particular metric or refer to some numbers, I'd have to use a third-party communication app. There’s no feature that helps you comment or communicate with your team in-app.</p><p>Secondly, Polymer's Basic to Pro plans only allow one editor, while the Team plan allows up to three. That's way less, considering the number of departments in your company that'd need access to analytics.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hzxMKgZuhDFzBp1PZbDQbvtzI.png""><h3>Reason 3. Lacks Real-Time Data Syncing</h3><p>Polymer doesn't feed your dashboards with live data from sources. It does allow scheduling a daily or hourly data syncing, but it's not real-time.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with its most expensive plan, $250 per month, you get hourly data syncs while still paying for the Shopify connector (if added).</p><h2>What are the Best Polymer Alternatives and Competitors?</h2><p>Some of the best alternatives to Polymer are:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Datapad</strong>: Track all your essential business metrics with stunning dashboards.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Databox</strong>: Comprehensive analytics platform that helps you blend and analyze data from multiple sources.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Adverity</strong>: Data integration and visualization platform.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Metabase</strong>: BI and analytics platform offering self-service and embeddable in-app analytics.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Luzmo</strong>: API-first, modern-age dashboard and analytics platform.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Looker</strong> <strong>Studio</strong>: Helps you with extensive data visualization.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Power</strong> <strong>BI</strong>: Dynamic, self-serve data visualization and analytics tool.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Geckoboard</strong>: Helps you build real-time KPI dashboards that reflect product and team performance side-by-side.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>AgencyAnalytics</strong>: Comprehensive reporting platform designed for marketing agencies and freelancers.</p></li></ul><h3>1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> makes tracking all your essential business metrics a piece of cake, all thanks to its ability to create stunning dashboards.</p><p>The software is easy to use, even for people not familiar with data analysis and visualization.</p><p>It’s a go-to solution for agencies as the tool makes onboarding new customers easy.&nbsp;</p><p>How does Datapad do it?

Crowded User Interface</h3><p>Undoubtedly, &nbsp;Power BI is a great platform to work on. But it does have some major challenges, like its user interface.</p><p>Power BI’s user interface is pretty complicated to grasp in a glimpse. Although pro analysts may find the UI cool, novice users can have a hard time learning the functionalities and processes of the platform. </p><img alt=""powerbi review #1"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/SWuuKjdWOXyOdKYyMoPXRJY8q3o.png""><p>Besides, we came across a few reviews where users compared Tableau with Power BI and cited that the UI of Tableau is far easier, quicker, and learnable than what Power BI offers.</p><h3>Reason #2. Complexity In Handling Bulky Data</h3><p>Suppose you're an enterprise with a ton of data. Tracking KPIs is already a tough thing. And if there are complications with data importation as well, it becomes a nightmare for you. </p><p>Power BI can't handle a ton of data all at one time; it consumes a lot of RAM, so your desktop can heat up and slow down every process. </p><p>Not just this, but it also creates a lot of temp and cache files that might fill your disk quickly.</p><img alt=""powerbi review #2"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/vqXegD5HPxgcvirUYKzDFnzjHs.png""><h3>Reason #3. Rigid and Complex In Itself</h3><p>Power BI isn't an easy-to-understand tool. It takes a significant amount of time for you and your team to get the hang of it, import data, create dashboards, and finally analyze them. With larger teams, it could prove to be really time-consuming and exhausting.</p><img alt=""powerbi review #3"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5bOLkuMS9MvlNvQImEz4i3aUaU.png""><h2>What Are the Best Alternatives to Microsoft Power BI?</h2><p>Considering the above reasons, it’s time to look forward to some good BI tools.

You need to know right metrics to track.</p><p>So, here, in this article, we have got you the 13 best product manager KPIs you should measure and the why and how of them.</p><p>Ready for another successful product launch? </p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h2>What Are the Product Management Metrics a Product Manager Should Know About?</h2><p>Product management KPIs are quantifiable measurements used by product managers to gauge the performance of products or services offered by the company.</p><p>These product KPIs allow product teams to track, monitor, and analyze the success of a product. They also help you identify issues, set SMART business goals, and make data-driven decisions.</p><p>For the essentials, a product manager's key deliverables involve business cases, market analysis reports, product roadmaps, and collecting and presenting data in an easy-to-understand manner.</p><p>To perform these functions seamlessly, product management key performance indicators come into play.</p><p>For example, let’s assume you’re working with a SaaS company as a product manager that’s planning to launch a health tracker which is completely accessible from a mobile app (no additional equipment).</p><p>Now, as a product manager, you're asked to launch an MVP (Minimum Value Product) and test its performance. To do so, you need to cater to a particular audience segment and measure the following KPIs:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customer Count</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Defect Rate</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Average Session Duration</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Support Tickets Raised</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customer Satisfaction Score</p></li></ul><p>And more such indicators to gauge your MVP’s performance.</p><p>Imagine having so much to track just for a minimum value product; what if you are handed over a flagship product? 🤔</p><p>Food for thought, we have curated a detailed list of the 13 most important product management KPIs. These are the KPIs every product manager must track to stay put in today’s competitive product market.</p><p>But before that, let's understand how and why these KPIs are important.</p><h3>Product Management KPIs Benefits</h3><p>Keeping track of product management KPIs can be beneficial in enormous ways:</p><h4>#1. Measure Product Performance</h4><p>Anything that's measurable can be improved. The same goes for your product.</p><p>That's why tracking, monitoring, and analyzing your product's overall performance is of utmost importance - from financial success to customer satisfaction.</p><p>Moreover, these KPIs are focused on the performance of your product. Hence, they are not influenced by other things going around in your organization. This makes them perfect for gauging your product's performance against set goals.</p><h4>#2. Track Product Development</h4><p>Product management KPIs are not just about measuring performance. They have had your back since your team started product development. </p><p>Some KPIs like delivery on time, team velocity, and resource availability help you streamline your product development processes. This way, you can control the activities and actions taken during the product development stage.</p><h4>#3. Focus on Product Quality</h4><p>Quality is the thing that will make or break your product. </p><p>Therefore, as a product manager, you need to ensure the quality of products delivered to the audience - whether virtual or physical - should be top-notch because most of your success will depend on it.</p><p>Few KPIs like product testing, number of support tickets, and defect rate are indicators of product quality.</p><h4>#4. Analyze Product Usage</h4><p>The product management KPIs also guide you through the activities and actions customers perform via your product. For example,</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How much time does a user spend on a page?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How do they navigate through your product?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>When and where do they terminate their buyer's journey?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Which feature of the product do customers engage with the most?</p></li></ul><p>Getting answers to these questions might help you plan your way ahead.</p><p>Now that you know why to track product management KPIs, let's have a look at some most crucial KPIs.</p><h2>What Are the 13 Most Important KPIs For a Product Manager?</h2><h3>KPI #1. Customer Count</h3><p>Customer count measures the overall customers you attract from all the traffic channels (organic or paid). It's one of the first KPIs that a product manager tracks.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Measuring this KPI is important because all your efforts are inclined towards increasing your user base.</p><p>Besides that, it can also be used to understand growth requirements, as the customer count can affect the operating capacity (this applies particularly to a SaaS business).</p><p>You can calculate Customer count by simply adding the number of converted customers (not leads) from marketing channels and ads.</p><img alt=""customer count formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/VGBpXZAf8yPTO4skJYwK6ibDpE.jpeg""><p>Also, you can refine the metric to count the number of existing and new users using a specific product feature. &nbsp;</p><h3>KPI #2. Monthly Recurring Revenue [MRR]</h3><p>Monthly Recurring Revenue is an excellent KPI for measuring a product's financial success. It accounts for the revenue generated from your product - or how much customers spend on your monthly subscriptions. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Now, this KPI becomes important because it will help you recognize your adoption trends. How your customers spend, and which subscription models fit right into their budgets.</p><p>This KPI is helpful for companies that have a subscription-based revenue model.</p><p>Plus, since it's monthly, you can always compare your past and current month's revenue and tweak your strategies accordingly.</p><p>To calculate Monthly Recurring Revenue, use this formula:</p><img alt=""MRR forumula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7DTtFpRNlAOGmhtKPdaGnjhRqEQ.jpeg""><h3>KPI #3. Average Revenue Per User [ARPU]</h3><p>The average revenue per user is the volume of money a company expects from individual users over a period (likely on a monthly or annual basis). &nbsp;</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Measuring average revenue per user helps you understand your finances granularly. You get to know why users and purchasing what they are purchasing and how much.</p><p>ARPU can help gauge the impact of iterations made in strategy subscription plans or pricing. It also helps businesses identify which tier customers add more value to their business.</p><p>A low ARPU with high marketing and acquisition costs will downgrade your ability to scale and vice versa.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to check ARPU:</p><img alt=""arpu formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/gRgc4WyaQsqACq7ueyhhoHT37w.jpeg""><p>We have used MRR here; however, you are free to use total or average revenue for a given period to measure ARPU. </p><p>Here's a quick example.</p><p>Suppose you have 100 monthly active customers, and the monthly revenue per customer stands at $ 5000. In that case, the ARPU would be:</p><p>ARPU = 5000/100 = $50</p><h3>KPI #4. Customer Lifetime Value [CLV]</h3><p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) refers to the total revenue you can expect from an individual customer over their relationship with the company. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>CLV is yet another crucial KPI for measuring financial success. The higher the CLV, the more profitable your business grows. </p><p>Besides, measuring this KPI helps you in:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Financial forecasting and planning economic stability</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Establishing budgets for marketing and retention strategies</p></li></ul><p>For a better ROI, your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) should always be lower than the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). </p><p>Plus, if your CLV is high, it means you have a loyal customer base. Or else, you get opportunities to improve your weaker sections and define better retention strategies, thereby reducing the churn rate.</p><p>Calculating customer lifetime value is straightforward:</p><img alt=""clv formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/w3yzJZ8UB7DEsPof88PIJjv3rQ.jpeg""><h3>KPI #5. Net Promoter Score [NPS]</h3><p>Net Promoter Score or NPS is part of the customer service KPI. Basically, it's a KPI dedicated to measuring customer satisfaction. </p><p>It measures the ratio between the number of customers who are likely to recommend a product to others and those who don't like it and won't be recommending it. The KPI typically measures this via a scale numbered from 0 to 10.</p><p>This can be a one-time survey form or a particular form. You send it to your customers and ask them to rank your product on anything between the number scale.</p><p>For those who give it 0 to 6 points are known as Detractors, users with 7-8 points are neutrals, and those who give it 9-10 are promoters.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The NPS is a measure that helps understand your customers' opinions towards your product or service. From a product perspective, this can help guide product development strategy and new features.</p><p>A high NPS leads to growth; in fact, you can witness a staggering <a href=""http://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/how-is-nps-related-to-growth.aspx"">20-60% growth</a> in organic traffic. Moreover, understanding your customer's opinions can prompt teams to create innovative ideas and more customer-centric products. </p><p>To calculate the net promoter score, divide the % of promoters by % of detractors.</p><img alt=""nps formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XommhBKlVFPhgvRX6HDWeraYA.jpeg""><h3>KPI #6. Product Stickiness Ratio</h3><p>The product stickiness ratio is the measure of the percentage of users that are active on a daily (DAU), weekly (WAU), or monthly (MAU) basis. </p><p>This granular metric allows you to identify the number of unique users your product is getting. </p><p>A unique user is one who visits a website (or performs an action) at least once within a given timeframe. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>For this KPI, the term <strong>'active users'</strong> varies from business to business. It might be simply logging in to an app or performing an important function like downloading.</p><p>But not every product needs to measure users on a daily basis.</p><p>That's why this metric is essential for B2C startups who have high-recency products. This helps them determine how sticky their product is, such as social media apps.</p><p>To measure the product stickiness ratio, simply divide the number of daily active users by the number of monthly active users.</p><img alt=""product stickiness ratio"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lronAZDGOdkaxc6MqXXV7wEl0.jpeg""><p><strong>Note:</strong> If DAU / MAU is below 20 percent it’s considered a good sign.</p><h3>KPI #7. Session Duration</h3><p>Unlike the average user session ratio, session duration is a mighty comprehensive KPI.</p><p>Session Duration measures the amount of time a user spends on its product since it was first launched. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The longer a customer stays put to your app or product, the more likely they're to make a purchase from you.</p><p>Not only this but measuring session durations can also help you identify which product page or feature customers interact with most and which product items they wave off. </p><p>Moreover, If you groom the data of bounced and churned users and calculate their overall session duration, in that case, you may discover endless opportunities to improve user interaction and understand what made them exit your website or app.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate Session Duration:</p><img alt=""session duration formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/3ztKrZbPbiryhBO0iAcB4lYaE.jpeg""><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Google Analytics is an excellent tool to dive deeper into your user sessions and granularly explore their interactivity across your product.</p><h3>KPI #8. Number of Sessions Per User</h3><p>This KPI metric tracks the average number of sessions initiated by each user. Typically, it's used by businesses to track the frequency of repetitive users.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>As said, since you can measure the number of times each user is using your product, you get to address your loyal customer base. </p><p>The higher the individual user sessions, the wider your loyal customer base. Moreover, the frequency of use is often a positive sign that customers are adopting the product.</p><p>When it comes to word-of-mouth marketing, Net promoter Score and sessions per user go hand in hand to determine your loyal customer base.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the number of sessions per user:</p><img alt=""number of sessions per user"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/LR9JpvdDUju3B3UlxMBfOxWYbDE.jpeg""><h3>KPI #9. Customer Acquisition Cost [CAC]</h3><p>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), is the cost incurred in acquiring new customers. This includes the time, resources, money, and effort it takes to convert leads into paying clients.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>With a <a href=""https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/how-is-cac-changing-over-time"">50% increase</a> in customer acquisition costs over the last five years, businesses are bound to measure this metric.</p><p>Because if their CAC is more than the CLV (Customer Lifetime Value), their overall growth will suffer as the costs incurred are more than the profits generated from acquiring new customers.</p><p>For the most part, CAC helps leaders ensure that they get a better ROI from investing in their customers. And if that isn't the case, it's time to reconsider the pricing and marketing strategies to survive in the long term.</p><p>You can calculate CAC via multiple formulas, but here's the simplest one:</p><img alt=""cac formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PtEfN9v8xrLr972PVHS0Ds9w.jpeg""><h3>KPI #10. Customer Retention Rate [CRR]</h3><p>Just as we discussed how important it is to maintain a lower CAC than CLV, customer retention is the way to accomplish it, and customer retention rate is the right way to measure it.</p><p>CRR is the percentage of customers who stay with your business for a longer term. It's an outcome of your marketing strategies and retention efforts that make up this KPI.</p><p>The metric also demonstrates your business's ability to engage your existing customers and make them spend more on your product.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Retaining existing customers cost you way less than acquiring new customers. Besides,</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increasing CRR by 5% leads to an increase in <a href=""https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/the-economics-of-e-loyalty"">profits by 25% to 95%</a></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Existing customers are more likely to try a new product and <a href=""https://www.business2community.com/customer-experience/why-your-existing-customers-are-your-best-customers-02199165"">spend 31%</a> more</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, having a good retention rate tells a lot about your brand's loyalty programs and customer-centric marketing strategies.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate CRR:</p><img alt=""crr formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/wDWBgFuOydPsfIaRFD1eJASh7Q.jpeg""><p>Here,</p><p>E refers to the number of customers at the end of a period.</p><p>N is the number of new customers gained during the same period.</p><p>And S is the number of customers at the beginning of the period.</p><h3>KPI #11. Customer Satisfaction Score [CSAT]</h3><p>This KPI might feel similar to the Net Promoter Score, but it isn't the same. The CSAT is the measure of how products and services sold by a company meet customer expectations.</p><p>While both NPS and CSAT are subjective customer scores, product managers tend to use both KPIs for distinct measurements.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>This metric becomes important to track because customers - the heart and soul of your business - need to be satisfied with your offerings. </p><p>Any decline in the trajectory will directly impact your company's financial health.</p><p>Moreover, you can use CSAT to derive customer satisfaction from using a particular feature of the product. In this way, you better understand what's working for your customers and what's driving them off.</p><p>To measure CSAT, ask for user feedback at several points through the customer journey cycle and do it before another subscription renewal so you have time to introduce improvements.</p><p>A customer satisfaction score is often measured as a percentage. Here's how you do it:</p><img alt=""csat formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pG8qPpmARAKq1afUlR802ps95fM.jpeg""><h3>KPI #12. Number of Support Tickets</h3><p>Get this; the number of support tickets doesn't necessarily imply an underlying issue faced by the customer. It could be a general request for assistance or random queries about the product.</p><p>Ideally, regardless of minor updates to the product, the support ticket count usually shouldn't increase per customer or a subset of customers for best practice.</p><h4>Why is it important?</h4><p>Reducing escalations of support tickets is a key function of an effective support system. It ensures that the correct issues are received well while the usual ones can be handled without escalation. </p><h3>KPI #13. Defect Rate</h3><p>Analyzing product defects and their frequency is key to spotting big product problems. A defect rate test benchmark should be in place to assess any feature to ensure a smoother rollout for all your customers worldwide.</p><h4>Why is it important?</h4><p>Without analyzing potential test failures, you might ship lousy unpolished features to customers of every type, and patching it up later in the stages is a far more complicated process than conducting thorough tests before the product is launched or shipped.</p><p>To calculate the defect rate, simply divide the number of defective products observed by the total number of units tested.</p><img alt=""defect rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/YeKuTwRjYdpoFKfSblGgL4UeQI.jpeg""><h2>How Can a Product Manager Create Dashboard with Datapad? </h2><p>Datapad is a mobile-first dashboarding tool. </p><p>It can be a boon for a product manager because we understand the multitasking a product manager performs on a daily basis (we see our product manager working like crazy all the time 😉).</p><p>And so, we simplified the overall process of collecting, monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing your product's data via Datapad.</p><p>Datapad is a mobile-friendly reporting and dashboarding tool that helps you instantly track and manage crucial product KPIs from your mobile phones.</p><p>Now that you know how Datapad is a dear friend to product managers, here's how easy it is to create a product management dashboard in Datapad:</p><h3>Step 1: Create a Dashboard</h3><p>First and foremost, download the Datapad app for your device (available on both App Store and play store), and sign up with your preferred email address.</p><p>Once logged into the app, you are prompted to create a workspace.

But most companies are still failing to create a data-culture in their organizations. Data tools are increasing in sophistication, but this is a double-edged sword. As tools are becoming more sophisticated, they are also becoming incredibly hard to use.","","","false","false","","https://framerusercontent.com/images/h54nFOyzzFEm7xygZiZd0ggb6e0.png","","false","false","true","<p>The concept of ""data-driven decision making"" has been around for more than 10 years. Nearly every organization that I worked for has purchased purchased a BI tool at one point in time; hoping to generate new insights from their user data.</p><p>Yes, BI tools are great, especially when it comes to getting complex data analyses done. As a product manager, I always relied on them for uncovering new learnings and creating complex reports. But truth be told; they suck at one thing – giving instant access to simple metrics.</p><p>I can't recall the number of times I just needed a quick answer to a major KPI but would have to go through hoops to get it. So I did my research with the hopes to find a tool that would give me give me instant access to my top-level metrics - but I failed...</p><p><strong>Below is a quick overview of what BI tools are good and terrible at:</strong></p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/QL65T3JFDHrBAtUmNpxeoG1Go4.png""><p>I would ask myself,</p><p>“Isn’t there a tool that allows me to connect to my data sources with one click and access my metrics in mere seconds?”</p><p>I could not find one, so eventually, I built Datapad.</p><p>In this article, I will share the problems we aim to solve with Datapad, including:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Aggregating all your metrics in one place is complicated and time-consuming.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>It takes forever to access top-level metrics.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You can’t access your metrics on the go.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Only specialists can enter and maintain data.</p></li></ul><h1>Why Accessing Your Metrics is a Huge Pain</h1><h3><strong>Problem #1: Aggregating all your metrics in one place is complicated and time-consuming</strong></h3><p>Do you recall your preparations before weekly/monthly/yearly meetings? They typically involve manually pulling data from all your data sources and consolidating everything on a sheet.</p><p>Even though you can automate some of this process, you still have to enter some data manually, which is time-consuming and super boring.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s seriously hard to consolidate operational metrics like NPS scores, revenue, costs, and live metrics in a BI tool.</p><h3>‍<strong>Problem #2: It takes forever to access top-level metrics</strong></h3><p>BI tools excel at providing complex analyses, but they are not great at providing easy and quick access to your top-level metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes it takes hours to get to your top-level metrics, maybe even more if your technical know-how is limited to excel. What if you need instant access to your metrics during a company or investor meeting? BI tools won’t give you that instant access.</p><h3>‍<strong>Problem #3: You can’t access your metrics on the go&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Some BI tools have mobile apps, but most people don’t use them. Why? Because you would spend your life making pinching actions on your mobile device and wouldn’t have enough time to check your metrics. BI tools have a terrible mobile experience.</p><h3>‍<strong>Problem #4: Only data specialists can enter and maintain data</strong></h3><p>I think the main problem is that BI tools are hard for the average user to navigate. That’s why people shy away from interacting with data.</p><p>Most teams track operational metrics like NPS scores. But it’s incredibly difficult to input an offline piece of data into a BI tool. You usually need help from an expert to make that happen.</p><h2>How does Datapad allow you to aggregate all your metrics in one place and give you instant access to them?</h2><h3>#1 Connect to Your Data Source With ZERO Coding</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/bEElYtiotR61kliHVhCgyjtLU.png""><p>Spoiler Alert: You don’t need to get help from your data team to connect Datapad to your data sources. We created a setup process that would take five minutes of your time.</p><p>With Datapad, you can easily connect to your data source and start pulling your metrics into a centralized metrics hub.</p><p>Below you can see how easy it is to connect to your drive, choose a sheet, and start importing your data into Datapad to create a visualization.</p><p>Right now, we only have one-click integration with Google Sheets. However, we are expanding into other platforms such as Hubspot, GA, and Intercom, among others.</p><p>Update Metrics Manually</p><p>Some metrics would be overkill to connect to data sources. I have always had a problem connecting data sources to get metrics such as NPS scores and HR-related metrics. I would have to put everything to sheets manually, and updating those sheets would be a huge pain.</p><p>With Datapad, you can easily enter your metrics manually and update them through the app.</p><h3>#2 Access Your Metrics in Mere Seconds</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/d5Zu76CKQ8Rr33cBzIjWR9MRRM.jpeg""><p>After you complete the initial setup, you can “Google Search” any metric you want through Datapad and have a visualization in seconds. All you need to do is search for the metric.</p><h3>#3 Create Visibility with Notifications</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1f59AwNi8ATOs778sNd1gJ2m8.jpeg""><p>You don’t need to ask for the updated version of the metric you are looking for. Instead, whenever there is an update in your chosen metrics, you and the rest of your team will receive a notification.</p><p>For example, if you are consistently asking for updates on churn data, you can set up a notification for it, and you and your team will be notified whenever the metric changes.</p><h3>#4 Start Discussions Around Metrics</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/AleqERDY2eHWjkgL36hKSGMerc.jpeg""><p>You can start discussions around your metrics by commenting and tagging people under each metric.</p><p>For example, if you get a notification about a change in customer acquisition cost, you can comment under the metric and tag the person responsible for the metric to investigate the change</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Datapad exists to make data access super fast, we believe that it should only take seconds to access your metrics not minutes or hours and your whole team should be able to collaborate around metrics.</p><p>We are currently on a waitlist and you can sign up from here!</p>"

Measure the Effectiveness of the Hiring Process</h3><p>Recruitment KPIs help you figure out how far or close you're from your hiring goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose a company is hiring for multiple open positions in the organization. Depending on the capabilities of your recruitment team, it can take days, weeks, or months to hire the right candidates.</p><p>Meanwhile, specific recruitment KPIs such as time-to-hire, application completion rate, and offer acceptance rate help you gauge the recruitment team's effectiveness in processing applications and providing competitive offers to the right candidates.</p><p>You can also track certain KPIs, such as applicant satisfaction score, to measure how satisfied the applicants were with the overall recruitment process of your company.&nbsp;</p><p>But is measuring applicant satisfaction important?</p><p>Yes, it is. A poor interview experience can lead to negative publicity for your organization and can prevent quality candidates from indulging in your hiring processes.</p><h3>#2. Streamline Recruitment Operations</h3><p>Recruitment KPIs help you streamline your recruitment operations by providing a 360° view of your recruitment process under one roof.</p><p>You see, when you know what channels or sources bring you the best pool of candidates, you can avoid wasting time and resources on posting job openings on every other platform.</p><p>Likewise, you can leverage recruitment KPIs to streamline your screening and interview processes.&nbsp;</p><p>Using these KPIs, you can also streamline your hiring process based on the following:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Number of qualified candidates</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>List of candidates scheduled for an interview</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>List of candidates in the negotiation stage</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Candidates who have cracked the interview but are yet to accept the offer</p></li></ul><h3>#3. Justify Recruitment Spends</h3><p><em>How much did you spend on hiring this year? </em>🤔</p><p>Stakeholders and investors are always keen to know these numbers, and failing to provide it can leave a stale impression of you and your business in front of your investors.</p><p>But not anymore.</p><p>Recruitment KPIs justify your recruitment spending by providing detailed insights on the cost of hiring candidates, money spent on job postings, and more.</p><p>Moreover, you can compare past and present recruitment spendings to monitor expenses and work on data-driven cost-cutting strategies.</p><h2>#1. Time-to-Hire [Time to Fill]</h2><p>Time to hire is the amount of time taken to fill a vacant position, from the time that the position is opened until a candidate is selected and hired.&nbsp;</p><p>Several factors can impact the time to hire, including the complexity of the role, the availability of qualified candidates, the effectiveness of the recruitment process, and the speed at which decisions are made.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Keeping track of the time it takes to hire is essential because - a long time to hire can be costly for organizations, as it can result in lost productivity and can impact the overall effectiveness of the team or department.&nbsp;</p><p>By tracking and analyzing the time to hire, organizations can identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the recruitment process and take steps to address them, leading to improved efficiency and overall effectiveness.</p><p>Another reason why measuring time-to-hire is important is - it provides valuable insights into the competitiveness of the job market and the availability of qualified candidates.&nbsp;</p><p>A long time to hire may indicate a shortage of qualified candidates or that the organization's recruitment process is not effectively attracting and selecting top talent.&nbsp;</p><p>To calculate the time to hire in a recruitment process, you will need to determine the time your business takes to hire a candidate, from when the position is opened until a candidate is selected and hired.&nbsp;</p><p>You can do this by tracking the start and end dates for each recruitment effort, and then calculating the difference between these two dates.</p><p>The formula to calculate the time to hire is as follows:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/SErkgH09boqGvdfqUjnTEQrkfOw.png""><h2>#2. Source Quality</h2><p>Source quality refers to the overall effectiveness of different sources of candidates in providing high-quality candidates for an organization.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>To ensure that your recruitment efforts are as effective as possible, it is important to invest in the sources that provide the highest quality candidates.&nbsp;</p><p>By measuring source quality, you can identify which sources are most effective at providing candidates who are a good fit for your organization and have the skills and experience needed to succeed in their roles.</p><p>Measuring source quality can also help organizations optimize their recruitment budget and allocate resources more effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>To find source quality, you can look at the number of high-quality candidates from each source.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you can track the number of candidates who make it the furthest in the recruitment process and see which sources they come from.&nbsp;</p><p>By looking for patterns, you can identify sources that consistently provide high-quality candidates, such as employee referrals or specific job boards.&nbsp;</p><p>By focusing on these sources, you can build a strong and reliable pipeline of candidates and improve your overall recruitment process.</p><h2>#3. Number of Qualified Candidates</h2><p>The number of qualified leads in a recruitment process refers to the number of job candidates who meet the basic qualifications and requirements for a position.&nbsp;</p><p>Qualified leads are typically identified through the initial screening process. They are considered strong contenders for a role based on their skills, experience, and overall fit with the organization.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Measuring the number of qualified leads is an important recruitment KPI because it can provide insights into the effectiveness of the organization's talent acquisition efforts and the overall quality of the candidates being attracted and selected.&nbsp;</p><p>By tracking the number of qualified leads, organizations can identify any issues or challenges in the recruitment process and take steps to address them, leading to improved efficiency.</p><p>Measuring the number of qualified candidates is simple:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/AtCgEZv78WCpizxPejIrbkVJT0.png""><h2>#4. Submit-to-Interview Ratio</h2><p>The submit-to-interview ratio is a measure of the percentage of job candidates who are invited to interview out of the total number of candidates who apply for a position.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>By regularly tracking and analyzing the submit-to-interview ratio, businesses can identify any issues or challenges in the recruitment process that may be causing a low ratio and can take steps to address these issues to improve the overall effectiveness of the recruitment process.&nbsp;</p><p>A good submit-to-interview ratio in staffing is 3:1 or better, but some industries can see as high as 6:1 or 8:1.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pqtgbpBOmvaZpoOSxSGR8VLKLkA.png""><h2>#5. Interview-to-Hire Ratio</h2><p>The interview-to-hire ratio measures the percentage of job candidates who are offered and accepted a job out of the total number of interviewed candidates.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>A high interview-to-hire ratio may indicate that the organization effectively identifies and selects top talent. In contrast, a low ratio may indicate that the recruitment process needs to be more effective in identifying and attracting the best fit for the role.</p><p>You can also know where you stand in hiring in your sector by analyzing the quality of your candidates vs. your competitors.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nUzXU8AzIKgTrr0WWjDWmVqQxY.png""><h2>#6. Offer Acceptance Rate</h2><p>The offer acceptance rate is a measure of the percentage of job candidates who accept job offers out of the total number of job offers that are made.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Having a high offer acceptance ratio is important for any business. To know the ratio, you have to track it. The importance of the offer acceptance ratio has to do with your company's finances and reputation.</p><p>Let’s talk finance first:</p><p>When you put enormous money into your hiring process, shortlist candidates, and send them offer letters, you'd expect them to take it, right? When they reject the offer, it costs your business a lot to do the process again.</p><p>As far as reputation is concerned, it's important to track the offer acceptance ratio so that you can know how good your brand reputation is among the candidates.</p><p>To calculate the offer acceptance ratio, use this formula:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/cgaQRj8t1GUKKBjOXcW29odFxi8.png""><h2>#7. Cost-Per-Hire</h2><p>Cost per hire measures the total cost of the recruitment process divided by the number of hires made. It is an important recruitment KPI because it can provide insights into the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the organization's talent acquisition efforts.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>By regularly tracking and analyzing cost per hire, organizations can identify areas where the recruitment process is inefficient or where costs can be reduced and can take steps to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the process.</p><p>Tracking cost per hire can also help organizations optimize their recruitment budget and allocate their resources more effectively.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/N65vmxhNijHRkspGujvT2B9CVDQ.png""><h2>#8. Application Completion Rate</h2><p>Application completion rate is a measure of the percentage of job candidates who complete the online application process out of the total number of candidates who start the process.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Measuring the application completion rate is important to know how efficient your recruitment process is.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a scenario to explain it better:</p><p>Suppose two companies, A and B, are hiring for the same role and have the same salary for it. Company A has a Google form that’s 5-pages long, whereas company B has a Google form that just asks for Name, resume, and contact details.&nbsp;</p><p>Who will have more candidates to screen? Of course, it'll be company B.</p><p>Shortening your initial application forms might get you a higher application competition ratio, thus refining your hiring process.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/2DHWWgL6BBfynFNH8hFsofNCY.png""><h2>#9. Quality of Hire</h2><p>Quality of hire refers to an employee's overall effectiveness and productivity once hired and integrated into the organization.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a measure of an employee's value to the company and is often used to assess the recruitment process's effectiveness.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Quality of hire is an important recruitment KPI because it helps organizations assess their hiring efforts' effectiveness and identify any issues or weaknesses in their recruitment process.&nbsp;</p><p>By measuring new hires' overall performance and productivity, organizations can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their recruitment strategies and tactics and make changes as needed to improve the quality of the candidates they are attracting and selecting.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, measuring the hiring quality can help organizations identify patterns or trends in their hiring success, which can inform future recruitment efforts and improve the overall effectiveness of the organization's talent acquisition process.</p><p>You can measure the quality of hire based on the following</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Job performance</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Fit with company culture</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Return on investment</p></li></ul><h2>#10. Candidate NPS [cNPS]</h2><p>Candidate Net Promoter Score (cNPS) is a metric used to measure the satisfaction and loyalty of candidates applying for a job with an organization.&nbsp;</p><p>It is similar to the Net Promoter Score (NPS) used to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty but is specifically geared towards measuring the experience of job candidates.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>cNPS is an important recruitment KPI because it can help organizations to understand the overall satisfaction and loyalty of their job candidates and to identify areas for improvement in the recruitment process.&nbsp;</p><p>A high cNPS can indicate that candidates are having a positive experience with the organization, which can lead to improved retention and productivity of new hires.&nbsp;</p><p>A low cNPS, on the other hand, may indicate that candidates are having a negative experience, which can lead to increased turnover and a negative reputation for the organization.</p><p>To calculate cNPS, organizations typically ask candidates to rate their likelihood of recommending the organization as a good place to work on a scale of 0 to 10.&nbsp;</p><p>Responses are then grouped into three categories:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Promoters</strong> (those who give a score of 9 or 10)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Passives</strong> (those who give a score of 7 or 8)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Detractors</strong> (those who give a score of 6 or lower)</p></li></ul><p>The cNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nQLTUf2eFOTEDOd7ze6jxiFsbGo.png""><h2>#11. First-Year Turnover Rate</h2><p>The first-year turnover rate measures the percentage of employees who leave an organization within their first year of employment.&nbsp;</p><p>It is an important recruitment KPI because it can provide insights into the effectiveness of the organization's hiring and onboarding processes and can help to identify any issues or challenges that may be causing new hires to leave.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>There are several reasons why the first-year turnover rate is an important metric to measure:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>High first-year turnover can be costly for organizations, as it requires time and resources to recruit and train new employees.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>An increased first-year turnover can also impact the overall productivity and effectiveness of the organization, as new hires may take time to become fully integrated and effective in their roles.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>High first-year turnover can also impact the organization's reputation, as it may be seen as a sign of a negative work environment or a lack of commitment to employee development and retention.</p></li></ul><p>Here’s a simple formula to calculate the turnover rate for the first year:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Lind8i2tMuv3u9mbTwSFFSry4.png""><h2>#12. Hiring Manager Satisfaction</h2><p>Hiring manager satisfaction measures how satisfied hiring managers are with the recruitment process and the candidates being presented to them for consideration.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>It's important to measure this recruitment KPI because hiring managers are often the primary users of the recruitment process, and their satisfaction with the process can impact the overall effectiveness of the organization's talent acquisition efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose hiring managers are dissatisfied with the recruitment process or the candidates being presented. In that case, they may be less likely to engage with the process or to make timely hiring decisions, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies in the hiring process.</p><p>Another important reason is that measuring hiring manager satisfaction can help organizations identify and address any issues or challenges in the recruitment process, which can lead to improved efficiency and effectiveness in the talent acquisition process.&nbsp;</p><p>One common method of measuring hiring manager satisfaction is to use a survey or questionnaire to gather feedback from hiring managers on their experiences with the recruitment process.&nbsp;</p><p>The survey could include questions on topics such as the quality of the candidates being presented, the speed and efficiency of the process, and the level of support and assistance the recruitment team provides.&nbsp;</p><p>The responses to these questions can then be analyzed to calculate an overall score or rating of hiring manager satisfaction.</p><h2>#13.

SQL Knowledge Is a Must to Use Redash</h3><p>Unlike other KPI dashboarding and reporting tools, to use Redash, you must know SQL. Without its knowledge, you can track KPIs but can't generate reports. </p><img alt=""redash review"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/03WbTdxNuQUeGSKbZ1MZd6JGK3Y.png""><p>There’s a way where you can auto-generate and auto-refresh your reports later, but to create your first KPI report, SQL is the only option you’ve got.</p><h3>Reason #2. The Tool Isn’t Meant for Large Companies </h3><p>If you're a company looking to scale your KPI tracking or an agency that tracks KPIs for multiple clients, Redash might just not be the right software for you. </p><p>The tool simply doesn't have features that might help you scale the KPI operations of your business. </p><p>It’s great for internal use, but you can leverage it to view presentations to your investors, send reports to clients, or bring many team members onboard.</p><img alt=""redash review #2"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Xq6VYBqsGuc4zM2eeAmok8dgE.png""><h3>Reason #3. Lacks Integration with Multiple Data Sources</h3><p>The platform has limited integrations, so you can't pull out data from multiple data sources. This is another reason why Redash isn't a scalable option and is not meant for large companies.</p><img alt=""redash review #3"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ok6smBEW4Idek86qWF7P73NpK4.png""><h2>What are the Best Alternatives to Redash?</h2><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Datapad: Onboard your team in minutes and track KPIs on the go</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Metabase: Great for quick dashboard creation</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Tableau: Built for mid-size businesses and large enterprises</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Looker: Tracking KPIs in-depth</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Trevor: Best for small businesses, especially SaaS startups</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Power BI: Stunning visualization options</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Plotly: Great for coders</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Mode: Set KPI goals and make data-driven decision</strong></p></li></ol><img alt=""redash alternatives comparision table"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/j23hcf6k5eGpB5xVbfD1n0iCSpg.png""><h2>#1. <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a></h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ZNwDMJbDdWWQEFueJTIfTGXLoOE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> helps you track all essential <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-metrics"">metrics </a>from stunning dashboards.</p><p>The beauty of Datapad lies in its simplicity and ease of use.

Templates</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/m7rLbpP0wFAeaQMSOB7G5u9Kuis.png""><p>Creating reports for your business is no easy task. You have to determine a lot, from which metrics to choose to design the right charts.</p><p>If you are an agency and want to create the same reports for multiple clients, then this hassle becomes even more burdensome.</p><p>Guess what? Datapad lets you do all this with just a few clicks.</p><p>With Datapad's templating features, you can:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Choose from a gallery of pre-designed templates and apply them with 1-click</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Build a custom dashboard and re-use it as a template by changing it's sources</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Share all connected data sources in the workspace with your teammates</p></li></ul><h3>‍Key Feature #2. Team Collaboration</h3><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lfMtGJd62Mic0PYHmbTCMfmPDNY.png""><p>Tracking KPIs isn't a one-person job when you have a lot of them; you need a team. But not all KPI dashboard tools let you bring your team on board.&nbsp;</p><p>Guess what? Datapad lets you do it quickly and easily.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, you can assign individual team members tasks to handle, goals to achieve, and metrics to measure.</p><p>With Datapad's team collaboration feature, you can:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get notified whenever there’s an update for any metrics and KPIs you track</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Communicate around your metrics and KPIs with your team members</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Get push notifications on your phone to stay updated with all your KPIs</p></li></ul><h3>Key Feature #3. Automated Reports &amp; Scorecards</h3><p>Wouldn't it be great if you could check your business KPIs first thing in the morning, straight from your inbox?</p><p>With our <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/dashboard-software-for-small-business"">dashboard software</a>, you can subscribe to any dashboard and receive daily email updates.</p><p>All you have to do is build a dashboard, click the subscribe button, and set your email preferences.</p><p>The best part is you can share reports with anyone, even emails outside of your organization or workspace.</p><h4>Step 1: Subscribe to a dashboard</h4><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/GgrWBX2fL1OgG1SLu8VXHYcJXo.png""><h4>Step 2: Check your inbox</h4><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/iTtKlXCFWIhxL9GYHa6e0cqiEek.png""><p>With Datapad’s report and scorecard automation, you can:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Subscribe to any dashboard</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Receive daily highlights around all KPIs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Send reports to users in and outside of your organization</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customize the date range, calculation, and styling of KPIs</p></li></ul><h3>Pricing</h3><p>Datapad has a free tier that includes 1 dashboard. If you want more, you can upgrade to the $30 Standard Plan, which includes 3 dashboards and scales with your usage. Datapad also offers a Business Plan tailored for agencies and includes dedicated customer support.</p><p>We are now offering an earlybird discount to all users, so it's a great time to <a href=""https://app.datapad.io/"">sign up and give Datapad a spin</a>.</p><h3>How Does Datapad Compare to Redash?</h3><p>Redash is a great dashboard creation tool, but it's more for tech people who are aware of how SQL works. </p><p>That’s because you might need SQL when importing data, adding it to dashboards, and studying your KPIs.</p><p>Although you can create dashboards via drag-and-drop builder and save templates, the option’s not scalable because it simply isn’t meant for it.</p><p>On the other hand, Datapad is mobile-friendly that needs no coding or technical knowledge to track KPIs. In fact, you can just tap on elements and create a dashboard in minutes.</p><p>So all-in-all, Redash is meant for users who have the technical knowledge and depend a lot on KPIs, and Datapad is for users and businesses who just want an overview of KPI performance but quickly.</p><p>You can get the best of both tools by using Redash to drill down on data and Datapad to manage your team.</p><h3>2 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Use Datapad?</h3><h4>#1. You Don’t Want An In-Depth Analysis But Just Have a Quick Overview of Your Data</h4><p>Datapad isn't meant for in-depth KPI tracking. The motive of building this tool is to save founders and businesses time. What you get with it is a quick overview of all the KPIs, and you can then guide your team via the app about how to tackle specific KPI outbursts.</p><h4>#2. You Need a Lot of Integrations</h4><p>Our app integrates with major data sources (MySQL, Google Analytics, Facebooks Ads, etc), but for now, we've kept the integrations limited. </p><p>We are coming up with more and more integrations soon, but now if you want to create 10 dashboards from 100 different data sources, create them with Redash and not Datapad.</p><h3>Pros and Cons</h3><h4>Pros</h4><p>✅ Lets your track KPIs from your mobile phones</p><p>✅ Bring your team onboard quickly</p><p>✅ Assign each team member a KPI and set individual goals</p><p>✅ Search KPIs and get their overview quickly</p><h4>Cons</h4><p>❌ Lacks some integrations to import data (coming soon)</p><h2>#2.

Such KPIs allow retailers to get an overview of how their business performs during a given period.&nbsp;</p><p>Different types of KPIs can be used to measure the goals of a business against the actual, quantifiable data for a given timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>Key performance indicators can differ according to the industry; for instance, a retailer's KPIs will vary from the manufacturer's.</p><p>Here's how a typical retail KPI is calculated:</p><p>Many retail businesses use average transaction value KPI to know how much a customer spends on an average every time they visit the retail store.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's assume that the average transaction value metric indicates that the customers spend a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>In that case, it can imply that either the store's higher-value products are popular or customers are buying products in large quantities.&nbsp;</p><p>A lower average transaction value indicates the exact opposite. To calculate the average transaction value, the total sales of the retail store are divided by the number of transactions in a given period.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Should a Business Track Retail KPIs?</h3><p>A retail business should consider tracking different key performance indicators because of the following mentioned reasons:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Monitoring Financial Health:</strong> Tracking KPIs in four critical categories - employees, customers, processes, and revenue, help the retailer know about the business's financial status</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Measure Retail Business Progress:</strong> Tracking KPIs like gross margin, revenue, the performance of employees, etc. can help the retailer know about the business's progress</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Analyze Helpful Patterns:</strong> For example, measuring the same KPIs quarterly can help a retailer detect specific patterns in the numbers</p></li></ul><h2>What Are the Most Important KPIs in Retail to Track?</h2><h3>KPI #1. Sales Per Square Foot&nbsp;</h3><p>One of the retail industry's most successful and often used KPIs is sales per square foot.&nbsp;</p><p>It calculates how much sales revenue a retail business can earn per square foot of available retail space.&nbsp;</p><p>To determine a location's efficiency, the income of a retail business is compared to the quantity of floor space utilized by the same store using this retail KPI.</p><h4>Why Track Sales Per Square Foot?</h4><p>The reason why a retail business needs to track sales per square foot metric is that it demonstrates how effective a retail store layout and retail personnel are at selling the products.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, this KPI is vital when renovating or redesigning a retail outlet and helps indicate if that redesign was successful.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a formula to calculate it:</p><img alt=""sales per square foot formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/emd0942haFQbQs79CR5tPfWI.jpeg""><h3>KPI #2. Gross Margin Return On Investment [GMROI]</h3><p>The gross margin ROI measures a retailer's profit from the amount invested in filling up the inventory. It simply tells you how much return in cash a retailer can earn for every penny spent on the inventory.</p><h4>Why Track Gross Margin ROI?</h4><p>Gross margin ROI is one of those KPIs that helps understand whether a business is generating profit or not.&nbsp;</p><p>If the ratio is above one, that means the retail store is selling its products at a price higher than the amount it spent to acquire the same (i.e., profitable).&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this particular KPI becomes very important for investors and managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here's how you can determine gross margin ROI:</p><img alt=""gross margin roi formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/cDnzRsLEE1b6s0RYdikqdSDHw.jpeg""><h3>KPI #3. Inventory Turnover Ratio</h3><p>The inventory turnover ratio measures how often a retailer can sell the entire in-stock inventory within a given period. This particular KPI is related to a business's supply chain and indicates its ability to generate sales and revenue.</p><h4>Why Track Inventory Turnover Ratio?</h4><p>The inventory turnover ratio helps business owners decide on pricing factors and manufacturing costs. This helps them tackle the on-season and off-season consumer demands.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the formula to calculate the same:</p><img alt=""inventory turnover ratio formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7mBfnBPxYvwjjv3Xz7HndfIaJco.jpeg""><h3>KPI #4. Net Profit Margin</h3><p>Net profit margin represents a company's financial standing after deducting all expenses incurred in operations, interests, taxes, payouts, and other miscellaneous works.</p><h4>Why Track Net Profit Margin?</h4><p>By far, the net profit margin is the most important retail metric because any increase in revenue won't necessarily translate to profit.</p><p>While gross profit accounts for the revenue earned after deducting product creation and sales costs, net profit, on the other hand, provides a more comprehensive balance sheet. It shows the profit earned after every single business expense is accounted for.</p><p>Hence, measuring your net profit margin on an annual basis can help you channel your resources, plan cost cuts, and introduce business strategies accordingly.</p><p>A SMART KPI for measuring net profit margin can be something like this:</p><p>Increase net profit by<strong> 20% </strong>by <strong>2023 Q1.</strong></p><p>Calculating this retail KPI starts with finding your net profit for the year.</p><p><em>Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses (operating expenses, taxes, and other expenses)</em></p><p>Now, put your net profit value to work:</p><img alt=""net profit margin ratio"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/GXwOq1YaFxkEtanY9NDq1R8v7gg.jpeg""><h3>KPI #5. Average Transaction Value [ATV]</h3><p>The Average Transaction Value gives you an idea about the total expenditure per customer for your retail store.</p><h4>Why Is ATV Important?</h4><p>Measuring this retail KPI is important because if you know how much people spend on your business, you can encourage them to increase their average purchase through merchandising strategies, identifying popular products, or shopping promotion programs.</p><p>Remember, a high average transaction value means customers are buying more or higher-value products from your business. In contrast, a low transactional value tells the exact opposite of the statement we just mentioned.</p><p>Consistently measuring your transactional value can also uncover valuable insights, such as your share of cost and profits from every sale and the trigger points in customers' buying cycle.</p><p>You can calculate the average transaction value by dividing the total revenue from transactions by the number of transactions over a period.</p><img alt=""average transaction value formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BZvTh4oGCzUrW15NCSXz8p82fco.jpeg""><p>Here’s an example to give you a proper idea:</p><p>Suppose a sale of $50,000 is generated from 20 customer transactions.</p><p>Here, the average transaction value = $50,000 / 20 = <strong>$500</strong>.</p><p>But, here are a few things you would like to avoid:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Not considering the costs of transaction or process</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Sampling transactions together as a single sale</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Up-selling products or services to increase the average transaction value</p></li></ul><h3>KPI #6. Customer Retention Rate</h3><p>One of the best feelings any retail store owner can have is watching their one-time customer become a regular customer.</p><p>None can match the joy of it, and hence, the customer retention rate is yet another crucial retail metric to keep an eye on.</p><p>Customer retention is the rate at which your existing customers purchase your product repeatedly over a period.</p><h4>Why Track Customer Retention Rate?</h4><p>Most business owners find this retail KPI unique because it tells them how well their business holds on to existing customers. Thereby helping them plan their customer benefit programs, offers, and schemes accordingly.</p><p>Besides that, here're a few unavoidable reasons to retain customers:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>The probability of selling to an existing customer is <a href=""https://www.pearson.ch/Informatik/Pearson/EAN/9780137058297/Marketing-Metrics"">14X higher</a> than that of selling to a new customer</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>An increase in customer retention rate by 5% equals a rise in <a href=""https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/the-economics-of-e-loyalty"">profits by 25%</a>.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>New customer acquisition costs have increased by almost <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-acquisition-study?o=73761&amp;t=1578940954&amp;z=196547&amp;sh=1&amp;_ga=2.55216299.1241445799.1578941068-1887897038.1530105100"">50%</a></p></li></ul><p>With all the above reasons, you might be gushing for a formula, right?&nbsp;</p><p>So here it is.</p><img alt=""customer retention rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nq3UOXfeWk9ou1jyQ3vcXf18Do.jpeg""><p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not count new customers acquired during that period in the calculation.</p><h3>KPI #7. Return Rate and Refunds</h3><p>Return Rate refers to the percentage of sales orders that have a product return. Apart from measuring the return percentage, this retail KPI lets you measure the level of customer satisfaction from using or consuming your products.</p><h4>Why Track Return Rate?</h4><p>There are five main reasons for businesses to calculate return rates. They are as follows:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Measure the level of customer satisfaction</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Identify the reasons that drive returns</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Determine customer need-fulfillment rate</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Make improvements based on data-driven insights</p></li></ul><p>However, achieving a 0% return rate is easier said than done, just as a benchmark; a return rate between 5-10% is a great percentage.</p><p>Besides this, a low return rate also helps you minimize your return order cost (transportation, billing, taxes) and build a trustworthy brand image.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the return rate for your retail store:</p><img alt=""return rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/qZzDRq5pDVrtMWsZczsO4UgiANM.jpeg""><p>Here’s an example:</p><p>Suppose you fulfilled 100 orders for the year 2022. During this period, 20 orders were returned due to unknown reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the return rate = (20 / 100) x 100 = 20%</p><h3>KPI #8. Sales Per Employee</h3><p>Don't you think a little bit of competition between your employees can be healthy for your business?</p><p>This retail KPI is wholly and solely built to serve this purpose.</p><p>Tracking sales per employee lets you evaluate individual employee performance and sales made by individual employees over a certain period.</p><h4>Why Track Sales Per Employee?</h4><p>Sales per employee is an important metric to track for retail stores and banks due to their high-labor volume. It gives them in-depth insights about leading and lagging employees, thereby making better training, compensation, promotions, and hiring decisions.</p><p>In fact, an increase in the KPI is a positive indicator of a company's workforce capability. Companies with a higher sales per employee ratio can work with fewer employees and still earn healthy profits.</p><p>To calculate sales per employee, divide the net revenue earned by the number of employees during the period.</p><img alt=""sales per employee formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ahXW5FUeO20aPWgplT8UMKK3o.jpeg""><p>A SMART sales per employee KPI may be to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increase the number of sales per employee to 10 per day by the end of December</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increase the sales revenue per employee to $5000 per week by the end of January</p></li></ul><h3>KPI #9. Sell Through Rate</h3><p>Sell through rate measures the percentage of inventory sold versus the amount of inventory purchased from the suppliers during the same period.</p><h4>Why Track Sell Through Rate?</h4><p>Sell through rate is an incredible metric as it can help you evaluate the performance of every product you sell.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some of its benefits:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You get to know what are the top-selling products of your retail store</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You identify the pace at which products get out of stock</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>You purchase valuable inventory that can sell quickly and easily</p></li></ul><p>Plus, you get a lot of customers because you stock up on the product that is most in demand; by calculating your sell-through rate, of course.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate it:</p><img alt=""sell through rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/MKOLQ0ITAIdIbMKvpa1dwNMq6qA.jpeg""><p>For example, let's say you're the owner of an electronics retail store. You ordered 100 LED TVs to sell in your store.</p><p>At the end of the year, you only sold 40 TV sets. Unfortunately, the other 60 pieces were carried forward to the following year.</p><p>If we fit the numbers in the formula and perform the math correctly, your sell-through rate would be 40% - an ideal percentage for the industry cited in the example.</p><h3>KPI #10. Customer Satisfaction</h3><p>Customer satisfaction refers to the process of measuring the emotions of customers via Net Promoter Score.</p><p>Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used research metric based on a single or multi-survey question with a scale ranging from 0 to 10 or -100 to +100; 0 meaning unsatisfied customers, and 10 meaning highly satisfied customers.</p><h4>Why Track Customer Satisfaction?</h4><p>Customers are the bread and butter for any retail business out there. This applies to all sizes of companies from every industry.</p><p>Technically speaking, measuring customer satisfaction can help you identify your loyal customers, churn rate, dwell times, and improvement opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, customer satisfaction and retention go hand in hand.</p><h3>KPI #11. Foot Traffic</h3><p>Foot Traffic is the most realistic retail KPI to measure and track frequently. We mean, what's more realistic than counting the total number of customers in-store. Meaning, the number of visitors in your retail store.</p><h4>Why Track Foot Traffic?</h4><p>Tracking foot traffic helps you figure out the popularity of the location where your store is situated.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you open a store in a certain location and don't get as many people coming in as other locations do, it might not be the best place for your business.&nbsp;</p><p>This retail KPI measurement can be performed manually, like:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Count the number of people who visit your store every day</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Use gate-way sensors to count the people entering and leaving your store automatically</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Use security cameras to calculate the foot traffic at all times</p></li></ul><p>To ease the data collection process, you can measure and analyze this retail metric on a weekly or monthly basis.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Working and improvising on your window display items highly influences your foot traffic rate.</p><h3>KPI #12. Shopper Dwell Time</h3><p>Whether a brick-and-mortar store or an online store, you always want people to stay longer, browse through sections, and interact with your store as much as possible.</p><p>Shopper dwell time is an excellent retail metric for tracking how long customers engage with your store.</p><h4>Why Track Dwell Time?</h4><p>Typically, the longer a customer stays in your store (physical or online), the higher your chances are of making a sale.</p><p>This absolute retail KPI can provide insights into your customers' buying intent, behavioral patterns, and purchasing process.&nbsp;</p><p>From a retail store perspective, dwell time helps store owners figure out how much time a customer spends hanging around or seeing through products in a particular store area.</p><p>This helps them better understand which areas of their physical store hook customers and which areas are blind spots.&nbsp;</p><p>Dwell time is often represented with session durations and heat maps, highlighting the areas of the store with the most foot traffic and how long your customer linger around specific areas.</p><p>You can easily measure your store dwell time using tracking and analytics tools like Google Analytics.</p><h3>KPI #13. Click-Through-Rate</h3><p>Considering the fact that every retail store out there holds an online presence in the virtual space, click-through rate is no longer just an ecommerce KPI.</p><p>The click-through rate defines the number of times your ad was clicked vs. the number of times it was seen.</p><h4>Why Track Click-Through-Rate?</h4><p>This becomes an important metric to measure as it tells you about how much traffic your online marketing strategies generate for your offline store.</p><p>It also helps you determine how well your marketing campaigns are performing and whether they are targeting the right customer segment or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a simple formula to measure this retail KPI:</p><img alt=""click through rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/7BZeFxoh0CygtGKlhCrjhXn80s.jpeg""><p>Some quick tips to get a higher CTR:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Work on crafting persuasive ad copies</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Position your CTAs at places that catch the viewer's attention (below the header, after offers, a pop-up CTA)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Keep your CTA no more than 3-5 words</p></li></ul><h3>KPI #14. Quick Ratio</h3><p>The quick ratio measures your business's ability to immediately meet its current liabilities without selling any inventory.</p><h4>Why Track Quick Ratio?</h4><p>Tracking this retail KPI helps you better understand your company's finances by considering both cash flows and liabilities. Moreover, a quick ratio shows how sales, marketing, product, and customer teams are doing.</p><p>To calculate the quick ratio, use the below-given formula:</p><img alt=""quick ratio formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/m2PEcN9fETIFuc4GlQmAqc57M.jpeg""><p><strong>Note:</strong> A quick ratio &gt; 1 resembles good financial health for your business.</p><h3>KPI #15. Cash Conversion Cycle [CCC]</h3><p>The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) lets you dive deeper into your retail accounting and finances. The CCC retail KPI measures how many days it takes to convert goods back to cash.&nbsp;</p><h4>Why Track Cash Conversion Cycle?</h4><p>Selling goods on credit is a part of the business. However, if those credits don't convert into cash for the long term, it might hamper your overall business health.</p><p>Hence, you don't want to be sitting on goods for a long term, so CCC delivers you with critical insights before you get on the verge of bankruptcy.</p><img alt=""cash conversion cycle formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/BxChyXaVSIG1rpot415HWXixV8.jpeg""><p>Here,</p><p><strong>Days of Inventory Outstanding </strong>(DIO) refers to the time it takes to convert your inventory into sales.</p><p><strong>Formula: </strong><em>DIO = (Average Inventory Cost / Cost of goods sold) X 365 Days</em></p><p><strong>Days Sales Outstanding </strong>(DSO) refers to the time it takes to receive payments after the sale.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong><em><strong> </strong>DSO = (Amount Receivable / Total Credit Sales) X Number of Days in Period</em></p><p><strong>Days Payable Outstanding</strong> is the time it takes for you to pay your suppliers.</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong><em> DPO= (Amount Payable X Number of Days in Period) / COGS</em></p><p>Apart from the above-mentioned 15 retail KPIs, there are other that you might need to track from time-to-time:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Conversion rate</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Year over year growth</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Total units sold per year</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Repeat customer percentage</p></li></ul><p>‍</p><h2>How to Create a Retail KPI Dashboard in Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad homepage "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Hg8Yg9ipaSHXQviAMlAmjh9Q.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a mobile-first KPI dashboarding and reporting software that allows hustling entrepreneurs to collect, track, manage and analyze crucial business KPIs instantly.</p><p>Its mobile-first interface helps you perform every function on your mobile that a typical desktop dashboarding software does - from data extraction to monitoring and customizations, you have it all under your fingertips.</p><p>Now that you know why Datapad is a dear friend to business owners and marketers, let's understand how you can create a retail KPI dashboard with it.</p><h3>Step 1: Create a Dashboard</h3><p>To begin with, the dashboard creation process, download our app from the play store (for Android users) and app store (for iPhone users) and sign up with your email address.</p><p>Open the app, and press the <strong>'+'</strong> sign on the top right corner.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, you are asked to give your dashboard a name and add a few other details to personalize your experience.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>You need to follow up with this every time you create a new dashboard.</p><p>Fill in the boxes and click on<strong> Create</strong>.

The written portion, however, accounts for $90,000 to $180,000 annually.</p><p>And if we combine all the content marketing activities – blogs, email marketing, webinars, landing pages, and P.R. spending, the spending will go somewhere around $342,000 to $1,080,000 a year.</p><h3>#21. ROI From Content Marketing Efforts</h3><p>Evidently, high-quality content marketing can generate a stunning <a href=""https://zenpost.com/blog/saas-content-marketing-statistics/"">ROI of 448%</a> or more for SaaS brands.</p><p>Blogs, alone, contribute a significant portion of this ROI.

In comparison, an average SaaS blog receives 1700 website visits from organic traffic each month.</p><h3>#22. Popular In SaaS Content</h3><p>As said, blogs are a vital part of SaaS content marketing strategy. They are the top-performing ones! Especially long-form blogs with ideally more than 1,900 words.</p><img alt=""Top performing content on saas"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/bgVHmh9LJ7FiKkisliIpwtw4bzg.png""><p><a href=""https://www.growthbarseo.com/blog/how-long-should-a-blog-post-be/"">Source</a></p><p>Around <a href=""http://ek-byford.com/saas-content-marketing/#stats"">36% of SaaS companies</a> leverage educational blogs to attract new users, while the other 26% focus on P.R./News-focused blogs.</p><p>Other than blogs, <a href=""https://zenpost.com/blog/saas-content-marketing-statistics/"">89% of SaaS companies</a> leverage other types of content to attract visitors, such as Feature announcements (22%), tech walkthroughs (18%), landing pages (15%), webinars (65%), and case studies (62%).</p><h3>#23.

Most Effective Content Marketing Channel</h3><p>For the most part, the effectiveness of marketing channels strictly depends on the product and industry of the company.</p><p>However, If you run a B2B SaaS business, LinkedIn is a treasure trove for your brand. Evidently, <a href=""https://foundationinc.co/lab/b2b-marketing-linkedin-stats/"">97% of B2B marketers</a> leverage LinkedIn to distribute content.</p><p>LinkedIn alone generates 3x more conversions than Twitter and Facebook together for B2B SaaS companies.</p><p>For example, Replicon, a SaaS company, used LinkedIn Inmail as part of their content marketing strategy and got an <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/linkedin-ads/get-proof-the-case-for-b2b-marketing-on-linkedin-infographic"">11X better response compared to email.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>But we are not saying emails are outdated.

In terms of Staff Training</h3><p><a href=""https://www.madx.digital/learn/saas-stats#challenges-for-saasnbsp"">43% of customers</a> have faced growing security incidents due to misconfiguration.

Is It Easy Enough for You to Set Up?</h3><p>The setup process for any dashboard solution involves many phases: Connectivity to data points, setting up key performance indicators, onboarding team members, and more.</p><p>In most cases, it might take hours or even days to get your dashboard up and running.</p><p>In sales, where every day is a do-or-die game, you must cast around a software that requires minimal effort to set up. Besides, ensure that your team shouldn't have to spend much time training for using the software.</p><div><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/latenightseth-boom-3o7btNa0RUYa5E7iiQ"">via GIPHY</a></div><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Check for the software reviews and ratings online. Focus on three major aspects: Ease of setup, learning curve, and availability of training materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>#2. Would It Give You Quick Access to Your Dashboards?</h3><p>Being part of a dynamic market where uncertainties are not uncommon, your dashboard should be handy. Not literally, but you should be able to access it instantly from anywhere.</p><p>This, especially, is beneficial for people with offline sales, like real estate agents or retail store owners.

Day by day, SEO is becoming the primary source of sales for several businesses. 🤯</p><p>If you’re one of these businesses, congrats, you’re on the right path!</p><p>But are you tracking your SEO performance correctly? 🤨</p><p>Get this; watching Google Analytics go up and down or checking for impressions per page via Google Search Console isn’t enough. You need to track several SEO KPIs to know your organic performance.</p><p>In this digital marketing era, aligning your business with the SEO best practices can help your business get traffic in the long run.</p><h2>What Are SEO KPIs?</h2><p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) KPIs are a set of measurable performance indicators that are used to gauge the effectiveness of your SEO strategies.</p><p>Unlike general KPIs, SEO KPIs specifically help you to understand your search marketing performance.&nbsp;</p><p>These KPIs generate in-depth insights related to your SERPs ranking, top-performing keywords, conversions, and data-driven recommendations and tell you about the areas that need improvements from an SEO perspective.</p><p>But how does tracking SEO KPIs benefit your businesses as a whole?</p><h3>SEO KPIs Tracking Benefits</h3><p>Although SEO seems to be a lighter term when measuring your business success, the case is otherwise. SEO is the heart and soul of your digital business.&nbsp;</p><p>It's the backbone holding together your online promotions, PPC campaigns, organic traffic, leads, and many more aspects of your yearly revenue. Tracking SEO KPIs helps you figure out the following things.</p><h4>#1. ROI on SEO</h4><p>If you invent in SEO, you might expect a return, right? Tracking SEO KPIs allows you to identify whether your SEO efforts directly impact your revenue and profits. To enjoy a good ROI, ensure that your gains from investments are more than the cost of investments.</p><h4>#2. Improvement Opportunities</h4><p>""You can't improve, what you don't measure,"" said Peter Drucker, and we feel that.&nbsp;</p><p>With the search algorithm being dynamic as hell, it's crucial to measure your search performance metrics. Again, improvements are necessary to stay at the top of the SEO game.</p><p>Measuring the right SEO KPIs can help you answer questions like:</p><p>🎯 Are your SEO efforts giving you any returns?</p><p>🎯 What part of your strategy should you change?</p><p>🎯 What resources do you need to do SEO?</p><p>Answering these questions can help you shape your KPIs around the optimization strategies in a better way.</p><h4>#3. Gauge Progress Against Goals</h4><p>Another benefit of measuring SEO KPIs is that it lets you gauge progress against set goals and objectives. Since SEO contributes a fair amount to overall website traffic and leads, your SEO goals must align with your overall business goals.</p><p>Just ensure you choose the right SEO KPIs for measurement. Ah! We know searching for KPIs is easier said than done.</p><p>So here's a list of the 13 most important SEO metrics you should be tracking side-by-side reading this blog.</p><h2>What Are the 13 SEO KPIs You Should Be Tracking?&nbsp;</h2><h3>Metric #1. Organic Traffic</h3><p>Organic traffic refers to the number of people visiting your website via search engines without paying a dime for marketing or promotions.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Measuring organic traffic is important because it's an excellent benchmark for your overall SEO performance. It depicts the traffic you earned from appearing in search results.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to Track Organic Traffic?$</h4><p>It's not that hard to track organic traffic. You can track it by logging into Google Analytics, going to the audience tab, and clicking overview.</p><img alt=""GA Organic traffic "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Z3tAM25rhepAHsWKvAliWeDJT4k.png""><p><strong>Note:</strong> Organic traffic is not limited to the overall traffic generated over time. You can segment your traffic based on visitor location, the device used, and pages viewed.</p><h3>Metric #2. Click-Through-Rate</h3><p>The Click-through rate (CTR) is the total number of people who visited your website or clicked the call-to-action after viewing your pages in search results.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>CTR allows you to determine whether your SEO efforts are inclined towards the right audience base or not. It also helps find where you need to optimize your page snippets to encourage users to click your results over those of the competition.</p><h4>How to Track Click Through Rate?</h4><p>CTR is the number of clicks that your snippet or page receives divided by the number of times they are shown in search results:</p><img alt=""ctr formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/nglrU9Dl5edVqpaZIU43M3tLg4.png""><p>For example, if you had 5 clicks and 100 impressions on a webpage, your CTR would be 5%.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong></em></p><p>Google Search Console allows you to see the click-through rate of keywords that your site appears for in the SERPs. However, if your Google Search Console is integrated with Google Analytics, you can also view CTRs in Google Analytics.</p><h3>Metric #3. Bounce Rate</h3><p>There're plenty of window shoppers out there!</p><p>They see your ad, visit your website, and then leave without purchasing anything (in case of ecommerce stores). Bounce rate helps you identify the number of times people left your website after viewing a particular page.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Instead of being clueless, bounce rate allows you to determine which pages attract visitors and which act as a repellent. It may be in terms of content, design, or if, god may forbid, your website is targeting the wrong audience.</p><h4>How to Track Bounce Rate?</h4><img alt=""bounce rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/r6sIHY52sky6Jc2vNSJDWTSUE.png""><p>For example, if 100 users visit your website or a particular page (total organic sessions) and 10 of them exit without taking any action (single-page sessions), your website's or landing page's bounce rate is 10%</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The lower the bounce rate, the better. If you suffer a high bounce rate from search engines, perform a content audit to find bottlenecks and improvement opportunities.</p><h3>Metric #4. ROI (Return on SEO investment)</h3><p>As we said earlier, measuring return on investment is a crucial metric for any business. Likewise, analyzing the gains made from SEO investments helps you plan your marketing strategy ahead.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The return on investment on your SEO is directly related to the success of your business - earn more than you spend.</p><h4>How to Track ROI for SEO?</h4><p>ROI on SEO is an everyday talk among marketing managers. And its calculation is pretty straightforward:</p><img alt=""roi on seo formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/RHDfevcFASZt39RqXln6otK4gWk.png""><p>A high ROI is better for your company's financial health. Anytime.</p><p>Unlike calculating your ROI for paid ad campaigns, ROI on SEO efforts is likely determined by expenses made on in-house SEO teams, SEO tools, analytics tools, and overhead costs.</p><h3>Metric #5. Load Time</h3><p>Load time refers to the time your website or its web pages take to load and become fully functional for users' operations.&nbsp;</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Load time is an important SEO metric to measure because it directly impacts the performance of other metrics, such as bounce rate, conversion rate, average page sessions, and more. Plus, your website's load time is directly proportional to the user experience.</p><h4>How to Track Load Time?</h4><p>You can measure your page load time with the help of Google's <a href=""https://pagespeed.web.dev/"">PageSpeed Insights</a>. Here, a score &gt; 80 is considered a great loading time, while a score &lt; 49 means your website needs speed optimization immediately.</p><img alt=""website page speed"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/kp29TYFZNaGMIPMcTkuHfn8k0N8.png""><p>According to <a href=""https://www.suddora.com/"">Suddora</a>, a good load time is within 5 seconds or less; anything more than that will eventually lead to a higher bounce rate.</p><h3>Metric #6. Keyword Ranking</h3><p>Keyword Ranking is the position your website is ranked in the search engine ranking pages (SERPs) when users search for a particular keyword.&nbsp;</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Back in the day, businesses needed only a handful of keywords to gauge their SEO strategy, but today, a single landing page is a home to hundreds of specific keywords. Hence, measuring and analyzing your keyword search ranking is important to improve your SEO game.</p><h4>How to Track Keyword Ranking?</h4><p>There are plenty of free SEO tools that can help keep a check on your target keyword ranking and positions.

Backlinks</h3><p>Backlinks are created when external websites link to your website. And when they do so, they are promoting your content in the eyes of search engines.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Link building is an essential aspect of SEO because it benefits your domain authority, thereby enhancing your SERPs. The more backlinks you have, the more popular and credible your site becomes for search engines.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to Track Backlinks?</h4><p>You can use Ahref's free backlink tracker to track the number of backlinks to your website.</p><p>Simply enter your domain address and click on <strong>Check Backlinks</strong> to get the results. Here, we reviewed our numbers, and we got a handsome 1,277 backlinks. 🎉</p><img alt=""ahrefs nacklink checker"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/CWHQ3ui6U65pbakFJ4oCMjziRQ.png""><h3>Metric #8. Conversions (Sales and Leads)</h3><p>Conversion rate, or the total number of conversions, is the number of visitors that not only visited your website but also completed a goal. The goal can be as simple as clicking on a CTA (termed as leads) or as complex as purchasing a product (termed sales).</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Conversion rate plays a vital role in determining the results of your SEO efforts. It's a tangible way to demonstrate how your website significantly increases its organic conversion rate. Thereby bringing new and more potential leads and customers onboard.</p><h4>How to Track Conversion Rate?</h4><p>The conversion rate is determined by the overall conversions from email sign-ups, forms, phone calls, direct purchases, and more. Therefore, measuring the average conversion rate over 3-6 months from starting a campaign is recommended to measure growth over time.</p><p>The formula for calculating conversion rate is pretty simple:</p><img alt=""conversion rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/PMFai7jpVs2o1KldUOH8nnlskQ.png""><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> It's better to track your website's overall conversion rate and conversions per landing page separately to understand better when, where, and how to improve conversions. Google Analytics allows you to gauge your conversion rate against your set conversion goals.&nbsp;</p><h3>Metric #9. Average Time on Page</h3><p>Average Time on Page is the amount of time a user spends on a particular page of your website. It's believed that the longer a user stays on a page, the more engaged he/she is.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Tracking the average time spent on a page is essential because:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>It gives you insights into how engaging your content is</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Identifies which pages need tweaks in terms of content, navigation, or user experience</p></li></ul><p>Average time-on-page is a reliable indicator of how a blog or a page would rank in the near future.</p><p>For example, even if a blog post ranks at number 10 on SERPs, with an average time-on-page being 4 minutes, the blog is highly-likely to rank in the top 5 SERPs in the coming week or month (because of the high average time).</p><h4>How to Track Average Time on Page?</h4><p>Here's a proven formula to calculate the time spent by users per page:</p><img alt=""average time on page formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/k0dxvBGsG8nS9V4yC6K9N5W5Fc.png""><p>So, you must measure the average time on a page, both sitewide and page-level, and work on ways to increase the duration.</p><p>You can track this in Google Analytics under <em><strong>Behavior &gt; Site Content &gt; All Pages.</strong></em></p><h3>Metric #10. Branded and NonBranded Search Volume</h3><p>Branded search volume refers to the organic search results derived when users search for a term that includes your company name, business, or brand. NonBranded search volume, on the other hand, is the number of search results derived from the search of a particular keyword.</p><p>In both cases, your website is visible to users in the search results; however, measuring both the searches distinctively gives a broader view of your SEO efforts.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>NonBranded content is typically the result of your use of keywords and ranking in search engine result pages (SERPs). Hence, figuring out branded and non-branded search volume can help you identify which channels drive more traffic and which need attention.</p><h4>How to Track Branded and Non-Branded Search Volume?</h4><p>You can use Google Analytics, Ahrefs, or Semrush organic research tool to measure the search volume for branded and non-branded content.</p><p>But what do you do after you have the data about this SEO KPI?&nbsp;</p><p>Quickly create a key performance indicator card on a dashboarding software like Datapad, visualize your search volume numbers with stunning elements, and instantly share them with your team.</p><h3>Metric #11. Meta Title Length</h3><p>Meta Titles refer to the text that is displayed on SERPs to display the topic of a webpage. According to <a href=""https://rankmath.com/kb/ideal-meta-title-length/#:~:text=the%20website%20traffic.-,What%20Is%20the%20Ideal%20Length%20for%20Meta%20Title%3F,title%20tag%20around%20this%20length."">Rank Math</a>, an ideal length of meta titles is between 50-60 characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's one of the important ites you should have in your<a href=""https://www.housesofgrowth.com/blog/saas-seo-checklist""> seo checklist.</a></p><img alt=""meta title on google serp"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/9BMY3GU5yvVmUDIfn0y092rtxsE.png""><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Though this might sound irrelevant to your business success, a title as good as:</p><p><em>Top 10 Ways to Win The SEO Game If You Own An Ecommerce Store</em></p><p>Will be displayed poorly on SERPs as:</p><p><em>Top 10 Amazing Ways to Win The SEO Game If…</em></p><p>If your target audience doesn't have a clear understanding of the topic you're writing about, do you think they will go ahead and click on it?</p><h4>How to Track Meta Title Length?</h4><p>There are various ways to measure meta title length for each blog and webpage. You can check your title length from the SEO plugin provided by your hosting provider, or you can use free tools like <a href=""https://totheweb.com/learning_center/tool-test-google-title-meta-description-lengths/"">ToTheWeb</a> or <a href=""https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag"">Moz</a>.&nbsp;</p><img alt=""meta title preview "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/MtocxP7571Ix4V2DHChDB67RUw.png""><p>To track meta title lengths regularly, you can easily create an SEO KPI card in Datapad.</p><p>Things to remember:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Display titles in SERPs have a 600-pixel width; therefore, titles with a 50-60 character limit fit the best</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Meta Titles should always have keywords related to the displayed webpage</p></li></ol><h3>Metric #12. Domain Authority</h3><p><em>""Domain Authority (DA) is a score on a scale from 1-100, where your domain is benchmarked in relative strength to all other domains on the internet,""</em> says Tommy Landry.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Domain Authority is directly proportional to your website's traffic, i.e., as DA increases, traffic increases, and vice versa. Tracking domain authority also helps you identify backlink and content marketing performance over time.</p><h4>How to Track Domain Authority?</h4><p>You can find the domain authority for your website using Moz. Simply enter your website domain, and Moz will present a complete report based on your website's credibility, keywords, backlinks, and more.</p><p>As an example, we researched the domain authority of Amazon.com. Here're the results.</p><img alt=""moz"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/eFqWF7Mx916by7TmuK8dvV2YA.png""><p>Besides this, Moz also provides page-by-page authority and top linking domains to the website for an in-depth analysis.</p><img alt=""moz page authority"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/dsByCScnNR5thbtxUMBN1I1I.png""><h3>Metric #13. Internal Links</h3><p>Internal links are hyperlinks that you put on your web pages or blogs. These links redirect viewers to another page on your website.&nbsp;</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Internal links form a strong bond between your existing pages and tell search engines that your website has highly relevant content. Basically, they are like the ""You might also like"" widgets for your content-driven website.</p><h4>How to Track Internal Links?</h4><p>Search engines consider one to three internal links hyperlinked to relevant keywords per web page as good. You can curate a list of all your internal links and anchor text to check for pages that drive maximum traffic.</p><p>Once done with the listing, you can create an SEO KPI report with Datapad.</p><h2>How to Create An SEO KPI Report with Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/hMXQlX2hkUGLmopet032HM76Us.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is an easy-to-use KPI dashboarding and reporting software that allows you to create beautiful dashboards and reports within minutes.

These indicators are commonly used in every business or organization to measure the overall business performance over time.</p><p>Generally, these KPIs are aligned to short or long-term business goals and objectives; hence, businesses always try to choose the most important ones for accurate and reliable outcomes.</p><p>A smart KPI is a refined version that has been through a process or a series of questions before making it to your dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart is an acronym for five different traits a KPI should have:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>S</strong>pecific: They are specific to a particular goal or task</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>M</strong>easurable: Can be easily measured in numbers or percentage</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>A</strong>ttainable: They should be achievable&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>R</strong>ealistic: They are the product of a strong foundation</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>T</strong>imely: They have a time frame attached to them</p></li></ul><h3>How are Smart KPIs Better For Your Business?</h3><p>The needs, wants, and desires of every business differ based on the industry, vision, goals, and other predetermined business objectives. Therefore, a copy-paste formula isn't a good idea when defining effective KPIs.</p><p>For example, an advertising agency would measure revenue per click, while a SaaS-based company would measure revenue per customer or customer lifetime value (CLTV).</p><p>Here's when smart KPIs support the differential purpose of your business.</p><p>They help you figure out whether the KPI you choose is directed towards your business goal, how it's valuable for your business, and if it’s measurable within a given period.</p><p>If we talk numbers, there are thousands of KPIs, but all KPIs are not essential to your business.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart KPIs refine or narrow down your hunt and present you with the most valuable and relevant insights for your business.</p><h2>Examples of Smart KPI?</h2><p>A simple yet smart KPI for a marketing firm would be increasing the number of followers by 30% every month.</p><p>This KPI is smart because it’s&nbsp;</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Specific:</strong> Increasing the number of followers</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Measurable: </strong>You can measure the increase in the number of followers&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Attainable:</strong> With certain marketing techniques, it's of course achievable<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Relevant: </strong>Being a marketing firm, followers matter a lot for brand value&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Time-bound: </strong>You’re keeping a tab on the KPI monthly</p></li></ul><p>Another prolific example of a smart KPI is Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).</p><p>For example, suppose we say a SaaS company spends $10,000/month on ads and acquires 100 customers through it. Now, the cost incurred to acquire a customer can be calculated as follows:</p><p><strong>CAC </strong>= Total cost of sales and marketing / Total number of customers acquired</p><p>So here, CAC = $10,000/100 = $100</p><p>The company spends $100 to acquire one customer.</p><p>Ideally, a smart goal for this KPI would be to reduce the CPA (cost per acquisition) over time. This can be achieved via better retargeting ads, appealing ad copies, and proper CTA placement.</p><p>Besides the above examples, here's a list of smart KPIs filtered for different industries.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/lsd4mtGZmlPUfb0oGXjzk5IUN7s.png""><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-examples""><strong>KPI Examples: Here Are the Best 30 You Can Find in 2022</strong></a></p><h2>What are the Differences Between Smart Goals and KPIs?</h2><p>Although the terms - smart goals and KPIs are used interchangeably by some marketers, there's a vast difference between the two.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who uses goals and KPIs as one, is vulnerable to confusion and possible mistakes when creating KPIs.</p><p>But we have made it quite simple to remember. Here's how:</p><p>A smart goal can be visualized as a finish line. You can look at a goal and ask yourself: <em><strong>'Did we accomplish that?'</strong></em></p><p>Here’s an example to understand better:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Did we get 5,000 new subscribers for our YouTube channel at the end of the month?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Did we increase our profits by 30% this year?</p></li></ul><p>These are simple 'yes or no’ questions, just like crossing the finish line. Because you know what success looks like, and you know when you’re successful and when you’re not.</p><p>On the other hand, KPIs are anything with a measurement scale attached to them. Just like a speedometer with a minimum and maximum indicator.</p><p>For smart KPIs, as yourself:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Is the campaign visible to at least 80% of the target audience?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>At what rate are customers leaving and why?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How much cost do we incur to acquire a customer and how can it be brought down?</p></li></ul><p>These questions require a comprehensive answer by analyzing data, insights, and events rather than a simple yes or no.</p><p>If this wasn’t enough, we have tried to explain the differentiation between smart goals and KPIs via four key parameters:</p><h3>#1. Meaning</h3><p>A smart goal is an ultimate outcome or result you want to achieve by accomplishing a set of activities. On the other hand, KPIs are metrics or indicators that tell you whether you're on track to achieve that goal.</p><h3>#2. Purpose</h3><p>The purpose of a goal is to set the benchmark or milestones for a company's day-to-day tasks. Every task performed in the organization is directed towards achieving the goal.</p><p>KPIs, however, are insight-driven. They are put in place to track, monitor, and analyze performance management of any business. They're not the actual goals but play a significant role in achieving the goal.</p><p>For example, suppose you aim to increase the number of customers from 0 to 100. In that case, you could quickly generate qualified leads via sharing lead magnets, paid advertising, or answering forum questions - but none of these would contribute to the overall goal of bringing in new customers.</p><p>In this case, leads are the probable KPIs, but it's not the ultimate goal. Increasing leads is your smart goal.</p><h3>#3. Time-Frame</h3><p>As both goals and KPIs are measurable and time-bound, it becomes confusing to differentiate between them.</p><p>However, there's one reason not to get confused.</p><p>Smart goals are created keeping in mind a broader perspective. Whereas KPIs are created keeping the goal in mind.</p><p>KPIs are preferably set for 3-6 months. This is necessary for analyzing your performance time after time and tweaking the KPIs if needed.</p><p>While you can't keep changing goals, you can always tweak your KPIs for better outcomes.</p><h3>#4. Dependency</h3><p>Goals are independent quantifiable measures based on the company's ambition and vision. Whereas KPIs are dependent on the set goals. They are created to access the timely and progressive approach toward reaching the goal.</p><p>In simpler terms, a KPI is derived from a smart goal, but a smart goal is not derived from KPIs.</p><p>Suppose we say your goal is to attract 100 leads in 90 days. To achieve this goal, you may derive a set of KPIs like monthly website visits, conversion rate per visit, the conversion rate of call-to-action, and so on.</p><p>These KPIs blend to give you insights into how you're going with your goals.</p><p>The other way round isn't true. Meaning that you won't be deriving your goals based on a set of KPIs.</p><p>As we thought, the differences might be thin to process, so here's a quick overview:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ouWVLxXbtogspJZ5c9VJzddGAY.png""><h2>How to Create a Smart KPI?&nbsp;</h2><p>Now that you know what smart KPIs are and how it's not interchangeable with smart goals. Let's explore a simple three-step process for creating smart KPIs.</p><h3>Step #1. Determine Your Goals and Strategic Objectives</h3><p>To get started, you need to determine which of your organization's strategic goals you're trying to gauge. You can stalk your competitors (in an ethical way, of course 😉) to see how they strategize things so that you stay one step ahead with your plans.</p><p>Or, you can talk to your investors and stakeholders about their expectations from the company by the end of a certain period and then plan your goals according to that.</p><p>But most importantly, remember that every business has its respective goals, which are planned based on many factors such as availability of resources, market size, budget, and other market conditions.</p><p>So, when planning your business goals, it's always wise to use a trial and error method rather than a copy-paste method.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a good strategic goal is to <em>‘Increase the flow of the marketing pipeline by 30% by the end of 2022.’</em></p><h3>Step #2. Hand-Pick Relevant KPIs</h3><p>Moving forward with the strategic goal mentioned above, find and research KPIs that are important to track, monitor, and analyze the performance of employees and the organization towards the goal.</p><p>Kick things off by thinking about what the success of each objective looks like. If you're planning to increase the marketing pipeline, then the meaning of success for you is:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increasing the number of contacts that enter the pipeline</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increasing the conversion rate of contacts in the pipeline</p></li></ul><p>Again, instead of copying KPIs, it's better to hand-pick them yourself.</p><p>While cherry-picking KPIs, place them into the SMART funnel to see whether they are eligible for being a Smart KPI or not. Here's how you do it:</p><h4>S for Specific</h4><p>Keep your KPI focused on your business goals and objectives, and ensure your KPIs are directly linked to them.</p><p>Being too vague makes it much more challenging to drive action-oriented insights. Hence, when finding the KPIs, ask yourself:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>What do you want to achieve?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>When do you want to achieve it?</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>How are you going to achieve the goal you set?</p></li></ul><h4>M for Measurable</h4><p>Look for KPIs that are easily measurable. Eventually, this will help you quantify your process and see what you're actually achieving from the KPI.</p><p>Example:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>❎ KPI: </strong>Improve customer satisfaction via customer service</p><p><strong>✅ Measurable KPI: </strong>Reduce ticket resolving time from 48 hrs to 24 hrs by the end of next month</p><h4>A for Attainable</h4><p>Ensure that you have the right resources and tools to achieve the goal via a set of KPIs.</p><p>Instead of relying too heavily on industry benchmarks, look inside your organization and see what's feasible for you.</p><p>Use data, knowledge, and experience to set achievable KPIs.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While learning from your competitors is wise, choosing what's best for you and your business is wiser.</p><h4>R for Relevant</h4><p>Hunt down KPIs that are relevant to your purpose.</p><p>Suppose you want to increase ecommerce website conversion by 30% next month. The relevant KPIs for the said goal would be monthly website traffic, cart abandonment rate, churn rate, conversions via the call-to-action button, and so on.</p><p>A set of relevant KPIs can provide you with more reliable outcomes than just gazing and measuring KPIs on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p><h4>T for Time-Bound</h4><p>Once you're done figuring out the KPIs, try adding a time frame to each. Set a specific date by which you expect to achieve or measure that KPI - it could be monthly, quarterly, or annually.</p><p>Ensure that the set deadlines align with the time attached to your goals.</p><h3>Step #3. Use the SMART Format to Write KPIs</h3><p>Finally, it's time to write down your KPIs. We've derived a formula to ensure that the KPIs stick to the SMART format every time you write a new one.&nbsp;</p><p>To make KPIs more understandable, use a color scheme as we have in the below example:</p><p><strong>Action Detail Value Deadline</strong></p><p>Let's see the format in action:</p><h4>Example #1</h4><p>Increase conversion rate to 15 percent till September 2022</p><h4>Example #2</h4><p>Increase the number of customers from 200 to 500 by next month</p><h4>Example #3</h4><p>Reduce churn rate by 10% in 90 days</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Starting a KPI with a verb tells you what needs to be done. Assigning a value ensures your KPI is measurable, and a deadline will do wonders for staying timely on your progress.</p><h3>How to Use Smart KPIs in Your Organization?</h3><p>Smart KPIs can be essentially used in five ways:</p><h3>#1. Monitor Business Health</h3><p>Smart KPIs act as a scorecard for measuring your company’s health. They cover every aspect of your company and identify what's preventing it from growing.&nbsp;</p><p>We've found that constantly measuring a few KPIs in each of four major categories - Employees, Customers, Operations, and Finance - can help you identify your company's financial, operational, and emotional health.</p><h3>#2. Measure Overall Progress</h3><p>You can use a smart set of KPIs like Net Revenue, Total Sales, Gross Margin, Employee Satisfaction, etc. to measure progress towards your business goals.</p><p>All you need to do is set yearly or quarterly benchmarks and use these smart KPIs to measure weekly progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, choosing the right set of KPIs is crucial to measuring your business performance efficiently.</p><h3>#3. Become Flexible to Adjustments</h3><p>Apart from using KPIs to derive results, you can also use them to foresee the future. Yeah, you heard us right! 😊</p><p>Leading indicators include KPIs that help you predict future outcomes and results. Thereby helping you adjust your operational and strategic KPIs before it's too late.</p><h3>#4. Solve Conflicts or Grasp Opportunities</h3><p>You can even use a mix of multiple KPIs to resolve inbound or outbound business problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's say you're experiencing a sales crash. Your approach here should be to analyze a handful of KPIs like the number of sales calls, number of appointments, conversion rate, etc.</p><p>Put these KPIs into your dashboard and measure them constantly to determine what's working best for you. Once done, you can leverage that particular activity to drive more sales instead of trying everything and going haywire.</p><h3>#5. To Analyze Trends Consistently&nbsp;</h3><p>When measuring the same KPIs consistently, you can notice standardized patterns in your numbers.</p><p>These patterns can be beneficial in several ways. You could compare the trends to predict when your business is at a break-even point (nothing major is happening) and use that time to do a system update or launch a company-wide training initiative.</p><p>You can see the performance of your team members on their KPIs and can use this data to talk about consequences, good or bad.</p><p>What’s more, use the trends to set realistic goals for your business.</p><h2>Track Your KPIs with Datapad</h2><p>Setting smart KPIs for business is one thing, but to know their performance, you need to track them first.</p><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> (<em>disclaimer: this is our tool</em>) allows you to track all your smart KPIs from your smartphone by building customized KPI dashboards.&nbsp;</p><p>How is that possible?</p><p>Our dedicated mobile app is designed for purpose-driven entrepreneurs who struggle to stare for hours at their PCs or simply don’t have the time for it.</p><p>Datapad's KPI tracking and dashboarding tool is jam-packed with all the features you look for to track KPIs, design dashboards, and collaborate with your team on the go.</p><p>It's a matter of minutes to download and set things up, and then it's just you and your team measuring business performance from the beach, the mountains, or even deep down the oceans.

Click-Through Rate</h3><p>Click-through rate, or CTR, refers to the percentage of people who clicked on a CTA or link after viewing your social post or advertisement.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>As of 2022, Facebook has an impressive CTR of <a href=""https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/social-media-ctr/"">3.86%</a>, the highest among other social media platforms. Thus, when tracking KPIs for Facebook, the click-through rate is something you don't want to miss.</p><p>Besides, Facebook's CTR is four times that of Instagram. It seems the perfect reason why marketers are pumping heavy money into Facebook advertisements.</p><p>A high CTR indicates that users are interested in the advertised product or service, while a low CTR may suggest that the ad is irrelevant to them.</p><p>CTR also acts as a benchmark for the performance of your campaigns. A bump in this metric can be due to multiple factors, such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Irrelevant content in context to viewer demographic (gender, age, or interest)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Unattractive ad design or poorly crafted ad copy</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Weak call-to-action button text and placement</p></li></ul><p>Here's how you can measure click-through-rate:</p><img alt=""click through rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/uedgW36KPGe9gmbM37SaqEFd6Q.png""><h3>KPI #3. Cost Per Conversion</h3><p>Cost per conversion is a social media strategy metric tracked by 99% of marketers in the online advertising industry.&nbsp;</p><p>It measures the ratio of the number of advertisements or post views to the number of successful conversions derived from it.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Honestly, this is the most straightforward metric to help you better understand your campaign's performance.</p><p>If your CPC is too high, it indicates a loose string in your ads. Either you might be targeting the wrong audience, or maybe your ad copy just isn't captivating enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, a lower conversion rate accounts for a poor ROI.</p><p>You see, if viewers are not converting into actual customers, what's the purpose of shedding $$$ on advertisements?</p><p>As per the <a href=""https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks"">Wordstream</a> report, the average conversion cost across all industries is $48.96 for search ads and $75.51 for display ads. So if your CPC is around these numbers, you're running a profitable campaign.</p><p>Here's how you can figure out your CPC:</p><img alt=""cost per conversion formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/C1yGfRhUfvAugbtctcibdmd8nU.png""><p>For example, if you spend $1000 on an ad campaign and you gain 40 new customers, your conversion cost will be calculated as follows:</p><p>$1000 / 40 = $25</p><p>Your cost per conversion, in this case, will be $25.</p><h2>#2. Instagram</h2><h3>KPI #4. Amplification Rate</h3><p>The amplification rate measures the number of social shares per post to the number of total followers. Simply put, it's the rate at which your followers take your content and share it across their network.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Amplification, as the term suggests, allows your brand to amplify or expand its reach. This reach is not a result of campaigns or ads, but it's a reach companies get from the word-of-mouth social media marketing of your loyal customers.</p><p>Basically, the higher your amplification rate, the more willing your followers are to associate themselves with your brand. And, the more delighted they're to re-share your content in their network.</p><p>Instagram, by far, has the <a href=""https://www.webstrategiesinc.com/blog/which-social-media-sites-get-the-most-engagement"">highest content interaction rate</a> in the industry. Therefore, measuring this metric becomes extremely important.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the amplification rate:</p><img alt=""amplification rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/WRm3vduw0ize8mmwP97lQbtMw.png""><h3>KPI #5. Engagement Per Follower</h3><p>Unlike the amplification rate, engagement per follower is a more contrary term. It's comprehensive in one glimpse and granular in the other.</p><p>We call this metric comprehensive because it measures engagement in all forms (likes, comments, shares). It's also granular because it measures engagement for individual followers.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Big brands like Oreo, Nike, and Dominos have millions of followers on social platforms, and they see a lot of engagement on anything they post. You, on the other hand, aren't a big brand yet!</p><p>Here’s how you can leverage engagement per follower KPI:</p><p>You can calculate the engagement per follower to determine whether your current follower base interacts enough with your content and compare the same with top brands' engagement rates. This will likely help you forecast future growth and work towards improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>The formula for measuring the engagement rate per follower on Instagram is pretty straightforward:</p><img alt=""engagement rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/pSl5hx4AS0gaU0SZptk9XjS10s.png""><p>Tracking this metric over time will give you a sense of overall performance trends, though you can also calculate it for specific social media posts to get an idea of the content types that resonate with your audience.</p><h3>KPI #6. Monthly Growth Rate</h3><p>Monthly Growth Rate measures the increase in the number of followers on your social media account (Instagram) over a specific period of time. Since the metric is preferably measured every month, it's also coined as monthly growth rate.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>A business's growth can be in terms of revenue, staffing, or demographic expansion. In the social media context, however, growth is defined by the increase in the number of followers on your social profile.&nbsp;</p><p>The metric shows how quickly your Instagram account is gaining or losing followers. While the exact number of followers you have is not so significant, the rate at which that figure changes is an important metric to track.</p><p>If there's a steady increase in the follower count, you're highly likely to get discovered and drive engagements from new followers. And if the trajectory is nose-diving, it's the other way around.</p><p>The average Instagram account sees a follower growth of <a href=""https://www.hootsuite.com/pages/digital-trends-2021"">1.69%</a> each month. So if you're close to this number, your marketing strategies are just working fine.</p><p>Here's how you can measure your Instagram growth rate:</p><img alt=""monthly growth rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/b01SsPdL70JpTVT0YbmvRp3LaM.png""><p>‍</p><h3>KPI #7. Instagram Story Metric</h3><p>For those unaware, Instagram stories are 24 Hr snippets that allow you to add music, mentions, polls, questionnaires, and more to it.</p><p>This KPI is dedicated explicitly to measuring the performance of your Instagram stories, i.e., how popular and engaging they are.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Arguably the most essential component of any Instagram marketing strategy is Instagram stories.&nbsp;</p><p>The disappearing nature of the photos and videos gives you even more freedom and flexibility than your feed does. And so, it's comparably a feasible way to put out content in a relatively short period.</p><p>There's no defined formula for measuring the performance of Instagram stories. However, you can get insights about the same in your Instagram professional dashboard.</p><p>There are a few good metrics to keep tabs on, such as story replies, story taps, story exits, and Impressions.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, a higher number of impressions indicates your story is getting good reach, while a higher number of story replies means your story is well-resonating with your audience.</p><p>There's no specific formula or benchmark for tracking Instagram story metrics, just keep an eye on the stats and ensure it's increasing or consistent.</p><h2>#3. LinkedIn</h2><h3>KPI #8. Conversion Rate</h3><p>Conversion rate is the percentage of people who viewed or clicked your LinkedIn post. The action can be as simple as filling out a form to as complex as making a purchase or starting a free trial.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p><a href=""https://neilpatel.com/blog/linkedin-marketing-tips/"">93% of B2B marketers</a> consider LinkedIn as the most effective social platform to win leads. Moreover, LinkedIn generates more leads than Facebook, Twitter, or Blogging.</p><p>So, tracking your conversion rate on LinkedIn is essential to identify if you're utilizing the platform's potential to the fullest.</p><p>Besides, LinkedIn doesn't have in-built conversion rate tracking. So either you can use UTMs and measure the KPI in Google Analytics, or even better, use the below-given formula.</p><img alt=""linkedin conversion rate formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/tIISMqkUiwWHYv7anWJphJ2IGE.png""><p>‍</p><h3>KPI #9. Total Impressions</h3><p>LinkedIn impression metric measures the number of times your ad or post was displayed on a user's screen.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The total number of impressions your page or social post gets is a prolific indicator of the exposure your content gets. Impressions speak a volume about reach.</p><p>LinkedIn counts impressions as the number of times your content <em>""is at least 50% in view, for at least 300 milliseconds.</em></p><p>The insights from the metric can be further used to measure other essential metrics such as engagement rate, cost-per-thousand-impressions, conversion rate, and more.</p><p>For the most part, LinkedIn insights allow you to track impressions per post. The higher number of impressions a post gets, the more people it's visible to.</p><img alt=""linkedin profile engagament stats"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/77P3c9E8ohORcnVpzgfO3CyxEA.png""><p>‍</p><h3>KPI #10. Reach by Post Type</h3><p>Reach by post type is a granular LinkedIn metric that helps you figure out which kinds of posts are getting boosted by LinkedIn algorithms, thereby being visible to a broader audience.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Content can be in any form: single image, text, audio, video, carousel, and more. But identifying which content types work best for your LinkedIn audience can ease your marketing efforts.</p><p>Here's our take on the type of posts that perform best on LinkedIn:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Firstly, text-based posts are a dear friend to the LinkedIn algorithm. These posts are 4X more effective than images on LinkedIn</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Secondly, general updates and mini-blog posts with a link to the full article in the comment section</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Video posts as they generate over <a href=""https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-video/"">300 million impressions</a> in 12 months, making them three times more engaging than articles</p></li></ul><h2>Twitter</h2><h3>KPI #11. Average Amount of Links clicked</h3><p>The average number of links clicked measures the number of times a link in your tweet is clicked to the total number of post impressions.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Twitter allows up to 280 characters per post, which means you can barely put 40-50 words of content per post.</p><p>Due to this limited content approach, marketers emphasize Twitter for sharing direct links. Hence, the number of clicks on a link becomes a critical metric to track on Twitter.</p><p>Generally measured per post or day, the link clicked metric allows you to identify the topic or content that gets the maximum engagement.</p><p>To track this metric internally, open Twitter and click on ""<strong>View Tweet activity</strong>"". Here you are presented with your overall engagement breakdown categorized by link clicks, profile clicks, and more.</p><p>The other way is to use this simple formula:</p><img alt=""Linkedin average link clicked formula "" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/5p3Yk5gb1DiJ1IXbWGNoXVwJ2M.svg""><h3>KPI #12. Number of Retweets</h3><p>The number of retweets is regarded as the <em>soul</em> metric for Twitter.</p><p>Just like the share button on Facebook or Instagram, retweets are a way of re-posting a tweet. You can even re-post your own tweet from the past to give it a fresh try.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Retweets amplify your tweet visibility. It's a great way to share likable content over Twitter.</p><p>Moreover, more retweets indicate that your content resonates well with your Twitter audience. Besides, retweets are a great way to go trending on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>To measure it, you can simply count the number of retweets you get on every post and keep a written record.</p><h3>KPI #13. Hashtag Performance</h3><p>Hashtag performance measures the effectiveness of Twitter hashtags in providing your content with better visibility.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Now, with ~30 words and a link, you can't expect your content to stand out from the competition. Here's when Twitter hashtags make the difference.</p><p>Ensuring that you use the most relevant, popular, and visible hashtags allows your content to be viewed by the right audience.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use the <a href=""https://www.tweetbinder.com/blog/twitter-hashtag-tracker/"">Twitter hashtag tracker tool</a> to track hashtag performance and get relevant insights.</p><p>Apart from the above-mentioned KPIs, there are some more which you can track when you scale your business:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Bounce Rate: </strong>The number of users who have engaged with your post but haven’t taken any action and scrolled down further their newsfeed</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Share of Voice: </strong>The visibility you have in comparison to your competitors</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Cost-Per-Click: </strong>The amount you spend on getting a lead if you run ads on social media</p></li></ul><h2>How To Track Social Media KPIs In Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad homepage"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oGbxkYMRL3ld2ftO5dFyZ7KqJoc.png""><p>‍</p><p>Datapad is a mobile-first dashboarding and analytics tool that could save you enormous time when tracking social media KPIs.</p><p>It allows social media managers to track, monitor, and visualize crucial social media metrics on their mobile phones.</p><p>You must be wondering, being a mobile-only platform, Datapad might lack behind in functionality.

But you would be surprised to know how wrongly most businesses use KPIs. </p><p>For example, measuring lines of code, time taken to code, and the number of deploys are not uncommon between businesses.</p><p>And to be honest, these KPIs are nothing but plainly misleading.</p><p>Such indicators do not align perfectly with your business objectives.</p><p>Software development KPIs must be much more nuanced to measure development projects' success effectively.</p><p>Moving forward, we have enlisted the 13 best software development KPIs you must track to stay on top of your projects. But before diving into the matter, let us ask you what makes these KPIs important to measure.</p><p>Is it the agility, flexibility, or management that makes software development KPIs the right blend of business interest and software quality?</p><h3>Benefits of Choosing the Right Software Development KPIs</h3><p>Quality performance requires constant monitoring. Besides, there's nothing wrong with tracking everything that goes along with your development operations.</p><p>For example, estimating the time taken for software development is an excellent KPI to measure. You may ask why?</p><p>The insights generated via this metric will help you:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Optimize the time spent on the development process</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Plan your tasks and goals accordingly</p></li></ul><p>Likewise, other software development KPIs serve a purpose – detecting errors, solving problems, or helping in decision-making. Keeping it short, these KPIs allow you to:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Monitor the company's health</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Gauge progresses against goals and objectives</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Analyze and iterate development patterns over time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Solve problems and grab opportunities via predictive data</p></li></ul><h2>13 Best Software KPIs Every Development Manager Must Track</h2><h3>KPI #1. Cycle Time</h3><p>Cycle time is among the DevOps Research and Assessment team (DORA) metrics. DevOps teams widely use DORA metrics to measure their performance and determine whether they are ""low performers"" or ""elite performers.""</p><p>Cycle time measures the time spent by the dev team members to complete a specific task.</p><p>Development teams use this KPI to measure the team's productivity and analyze the development process's efficiency.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Cycle time matters because the lower it is, the surplus code your team is shipping. Plus, measuring this metric can benefit you in two ways.</p><p>Firstly, you get to know how long it takes to complete a task and use data to objectively quantify your team's performance. You can also predict the cycle time for future similar development projects.</p><p>Secondly, you can spot any process blockages, like something causing inconsistencies or obstruction. </p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate cycle time:</p><img alt=""cycle time formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/0pvAQtUajCXbE7cGagnd1lAMkMU.png""><h3>KPI #2. Development Velocity</h3><p>Development velocity refers to the amount of work your team can complete during a sprint.</p><p>For those unaware, a sprint is a set period of time during which specific tasks are to be completed. </p><p>It's basically a part of the Scrum methodology used by agile companies to manage employee productivity. </p><p>So, during sprints, most teams use story points to estimate the amount of effort it will take to complete a task. The measure is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the quickest task and 10 being the most complicated.</p><h3>Why Is It Important?</h3><p>Development velocity lets you and your team analyze your efforts and foresee your performance on other recurring tasks. You can also compare past and current sprint velocities to measure team productivity.</p><p>Suppose we say, out of three consecutive sprints, your velocity stood at 100,120, and 140, respectively. This data can help you understand three important things:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Workload your team can handle</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Increase in productivity over sprints</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Average time taken to complete projects</p></li></ul><p>Development velocity also conveys a lot about how realistic your business goals are.</p><p>Here's a quick formula to measure this software KPI:</p><img alt=""development velocity"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oG79HLRkpoGD8IRVJP5yDH3Fzzw.png""><h3>KPI #3. Change Failure Rate</h3><p>The change failure rate (CFR) &nbsp;is an extremely useful metric for measuring quality. It’s the percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production.</p><h4>Why Is It Important? </h4><p>Code quality is subjective in nature, making it hard to measure and analyze. But however complex its measurement is, it's an important metric to track.</p><p>The change failure rate is a handy metric that development teams use to test the quality of source codes.</p><p>A lower CFR means that your code has fewer bugs and is of higher quality. In contrast, a higher CFR means the other way around.</p><p>A higher CFR also means that your dev team must again put in the time, resources, and brain to revamp the code and make it error-free. Doing this complicates the overall development process and adds blockage to the free flow of tasks and operations.</p><p>Here's a straightforward formula to calculate CFR:</p><img alt=""cfr formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/XlDCjMhXvx0KCtx1SFK37PodvE.png""><h3>KPI #4. Deployment Frequency</h3><p>Deployment frequency is among the four DORA metrics and, comprehensively, a core Agile delivery metric.</p><p>This metric refers to the pace at which your development team deploys code into staging, testing, or production departments.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Deployment Frequency is an essential metric to measure because it directly aligns with the objective of Agile software delivery, i.e., fast and continuous code delivery. </p><p>Moreover, as we said, this is a comprehensive metric; it's interlinked with a few other DORA metrics such as cycle time, change failure rate, mean time to recover, and more.</p><p>For example, if DevOps requires 1000 lines of code, is it better to deploy the whole code at once or segment it into fractions or batches, like 5 batches of 200 lines of code?</p><p>The best way to accomplish the goal would be to deploy 5 batches of code. </p><p>You may ask why?</p><p>Small fractions of code, say 200 lines, would take less time to be deployed. Plus, by doing this, you reduce cycle time and allow your production team to get started without waiting for the whole code at once.</p><p>Besides, since the deployments are small, you're entirely in control of them. Even if a code breaks or malfunctions, you know precisely which chunk to look upon. </p><p>For the most part, this metric is essential for:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Organizations looking to increase their agile development maturity</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Organizations with a history of infrequent or deployed deployments</p></li></ul><h3>KPI #5. Pull Request [PR] Size</h3><p>A pull request, also known as a merge request, is when a developer begins the process of merging new code changes with the main project after reviewing them.</p><p>PR size is the number of pull requests reviewed and merged with the ongoing project trajectory over a period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Pull request is a way for developers to tell that they are done with writing the code and that it is ready to be reviewed and merged.</p><p>However, an ideal pull request might take up to 4 days. Hence, an increase in PR size accounts for the delay in cycle time.</p><p>You must ensure that your PR size stays low to get things going smoothly. You can do that by reviewing certain chunks of code in regular intervals instead of waiting for the right moment (which, philosophically, never comes).</p><p>Typically, a PR size of less than 250 code changes is considered to be elite by DevOps.</p><h3>KPI #6. Defect Detection Ratio [DDR]</h3><p>We believe in the supremacy of technology, but we also believe that every technical product faces defects. It can be detected during the testing phase, or it might slip to your end user. </p><p>The defect detection ratio, also calculated as a percentage, is the ratio of defects found prior to release vs. the number of defects found post-release.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The DDR helps you gauge the effectiveness of your testing team.</p><p>For example, you can track the percentage of defects that surpass your development and testing phase and land with your customers. Eventually, this indicates poor user experience, hampering your overall software quality and integrity.</p><p>Moreover, by measuring this software KPI, you can:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Measure the effectiveness of the process adopted for testing</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Expose the weakest link in the process, and take corrective measures</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Evaluate the performance of the testing team</p></li></ul><p>In general, a higher DDR indicates the impressive performance of your testing team and vice versa.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate defect detection percentage:</p><img alt=""defect detection ratio"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/yhUJeiIgUreHSHpo3wdC37djHnI.png""><p>Here,</p><p>A is the number of defects at the moment of software version release </p><p>B is the number of defects that escaped testing and are detected by end-users</p><p>Suppose a case where 100 defects were detected in the testing phase and 20 defects were found by customers after release. Here, the defect detection percentage will be:</p><p>[100 / (100+20)] X 100 = 83.33.</p><p>Your DDP stands at 83.33%.</p><h3>KPI #7. Code Coverage Percentage</h3><p>Code coverage percentage is yet another essential metric for DevOps.</p><p>The CCP is used to measure the quality of code deployed for testing or production purposes. </p><p>Also known as test coverage, this metric determines how your source code executes when tested.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>The CCP allows software development managers to identify the quality of code. The metric mainly shows how many code lines are successfully executed and how many of them need compilation or optimization.</p><p>The higher the CCP, the more reliable and efficient your code is, and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Coding, being a next-level language for humans, often accounts for some human errors. Therefore, one shouldn't aim for a 100% CCP; the more, the better.</p><img alt=""code coverage percentage"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/taJh5t8IyOvYvZDifg6M2AxCWls.png""><p>A lower CCP indicates that the source code provided is often encountering bugs and errors during testing. You can use this data to improve and raise the bar of your team's coding unit.</p><h3>KPI #8. Code Churn</h3><p>Code churn, often termed code stability, is the measure of the number of times code changes or requires iterations over a period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Code stability is a lethargic yet essential metric to measure.</p><p>It's used during DevOps to measure the number of times a code is being rewritten or iterated due to introducing a new feature or upgraded software version.</p><p>While code churn isn't something bad or unusual, a higher code churn often results in high maintenance and thus caters to high risk. </p><p>An experiment by GitPrime's data science team found that the average code churn levels run between 13-30% (70-87% code efficiency).</p><img alt=""code churn"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/jrNmd9ZlmMiuQqLb31C31Dnn0.png""><p>‍</p><p><a href=""https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/tutorials/code-churn"">Source</a></p><p>However, DevOps can comfortably operate at 25% code churn, which depicts 75% efficiency of the code.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate the code churn rate:</p><img alt=""code churn ratio formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/tw9WsOgzDG2R5QiJ1Q03e6vEiI.png""><h3>KPI #9. Code Simplicity</h3><p>A simple code executed successfully is of more value than a complex code which requires rigorous testing and iterations.</p><p>Code simplicity, as the name suggests, measures the number of independent paths your code has.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, simpler code is easier to test and maintain for your testing team. It reduces the overall time consumed in testing and iterating the code for perfection.</p><p>Understand it like this: the fewer independent paths your code has, the higher the code's simplicity and the less time it takes for support, review, testing, and debugging.</p><h3>KPI #10. Cumulative Flow</h3><p>Software development processes are complicated as hell. They have a cluster of “Ongoing"" and ""To be Done"" tasks that need to be streamlined.</p><p>Cumulative Flow demonstrates the status quo of your software tasks or tickets via visual diagrams.</p><p>Generally represented as a table, cumulative flow uses different colors to represent different stages like 'Approved,' 'In Progress,' 'Backlog,' and more.</p><p>Moreover, these colors are arranged in bands so that the width of the band correlates to cycle time. </p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Cumulative flow revolves around three essential engineering metrics of the workflow: Throughput, cycle time, and work in progress.</p><p>Thereby allowing teams to identify bottlenecks and work towards stability of the workflow. Cumulative flow becomes important when dealing with long-term or complex processes requiring a streamlined development process and effective collaboration between departments. </p><h3>KPI #11. Bug Rates</h3><p>Bug rates refer to the frequency of bugs being discovered during testing.</p><p>Simply put, it is the process of logging and monitoring the bugs or errors encountered during software testing.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>According to a <a href=""https://www.nist.gov/"">National Institute of Standard Technology</a> study, software bugs cost the U.S economy $59.9 billion annually. That makes it pretty clear why it's an important metric to measure.</p><p>This metric is similar to the defect rate but not essentially common to that. </p><p>Majorly, bugs are measured from two aspects: the total number of bugs and the severity of the bugs.</p><p>While you can always count the number of bugs and fix the maximum number, the severity of bugs should remain minimum. </p><p>Here's a simple formula to measure bug rate:</p><img alt=""bug rate formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/VnmB0Xq5lswABB8DM4iTizQ8e6c.png""><p>If the bug rate is more than the acceptable benchmark or the severity of the bugs is higher than the medium level, it's time to make adjustments to your code.</p><h3>KPI #12. Mean Time Between Failures [MTBF] and Mean Time to Repair [MTTR]</h3><p>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) are two distinct metrics used to gauge a unified objective - the reliability of your software.</p><p>MTBF measures the average time between two failures in the software, and MTTR is simply the time it takes to repair those faults.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Failures are part of software development; even professionals bow down to them. So, it's evident that you can't develop a software without tasting failures.</p><p>But you can minimize the damage caused by those failures by proactively measuring the number of occurring failures and optimizing the time it takes to repair those faults.</p><p>Here's how you can calculate MTBF and MTTR:</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/iR8NuOBPXbVXUylIfIimtMsWkI.png""><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Calculating the metrics simultaneously can help you measure your software development teams' overall productivity and efficiency.</p><h3>KPI #13. Net Promoter Score</h3><p>The end users of every software are customers, be it B2C or B2B. And what matters most is the customer satisfaction </p><p>Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used metric that measures the level of satisfaction users get after using your product or service.</p><p>Through NPS, you get a score between 0 to 10, where 0 reflects the worst experience of your software, while a rating above 8 resonates with an excellent user experience.</p><p>To ease the measurement process, the people who vote between 0 to 4 are termed Detractors, 5 to 6 are termed neutral, and above 6 are known as promoters.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>If the number of promoters exceeds the number of detractors, your software is performing impressively well. And if it's the other way, you need to make changes in the final software to make it better for users.</p><p>Here's a simple formula to calculate NPS:</p><img alt=""nps formula"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/D9vLcvtXyzUTuYHHfkE9Sq2GzIE.png""><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Before launching your software to the market, share an NPS from within your organization and ask employees and executives to test the software on their own and give feedback via NPS. </p><h2>How To Create a Software KPI Dashboard In Datapad?</h2><img alt=""datapad kpi tracking tool"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/y9raPxEOFM9jm463VsS9AxRCAU.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> is a mobile-friendly dashboard creation tool that allows coders and software development managers to collect, monitor, and analyze DevOps data.</p><p>Development operations have a cluster of data waiting to be nourished and transformed into easy-to-understand data visuals. </p><p>And our tool offers precisely the same USP.</p><p>With Datapad, you can manage your development processes through your smartphone.

Why Do You Need to Track KPIs for Startups? 	What Are the 10 Most Important KPIs You Should Track? 	How do Startups Know What KPIs to Set and Track?  &nbsp;How to Track Your Startup KPIs with Datapad?  </div><div><br></div><h2>What are Startup KPIs?</h2><p>Businesses use metrics to measure their value and success. Most startups have only two things in mind when they kick things off - <strong>Revenue</strong> and <strong>Investment</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Being a part of a startup, it becomes even more necessary to know about the KPIs as these help keep you on a focused path essential to achieving sustained financial success down the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Startup KPIs are different from metrics that simply show the outcome of a particular activity. Instead, startup KPIs show you what every step of the customer journey looks like.&nbsp;</p><p>KPIs allow startups to identify, evaluate, and develop a better strategy to improve operational efficiency. Without that, no startup can drive meaningful growth.</p><p>Not only that, no startup has ever been successful without tracking KPIs. They’re the quantitative and qualitative measures that enable startups to grow and, more importantly, sustain growth.</p><p>That being said, let’s see why startup KPIs are important to track.</p><div><br></div><h2>Why Do You Need to Track KPIs for Startups?</h2><p>Tracking KPIs is crucial for startups as it allows them to evaluate their process and better understand their current efforts and related outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t consider tracking KPIs and key metrics, you might make random decisions based on nothing, and it can cost your company a fortune.</p><p>So, here are some reasons why tracking KPIs are important for startups:</p><h3>#1. KPIs Show You the Right Path</h3><p>By tracking certain KPIs, startups can get an insight into recent progress, which allows them to forecast their future growth.&nbsp;</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/UcbQKv2vj02p5gW3gdahkXCQRT4.gif""><p><a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/Channel7AU-farmerau-farmer-wants-a-wife-right-path-3qb21t7xoiVystyQAg"">Source</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s consider a SaaS startup issue, for example.</p><p>The startup is dealing with a major issue with the company's revenue. They see a monthly decline in their revenue, and it’s breaking their team apart.</p><p>What do they do? 🤔</p><p>The CEO of this startup tracks the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and customer churn rate and finds out that they’re having a hard time retaining customers.</p><p>When the CEO further analyzed the situation, he discovered that the software's UX was nowhere close to its competition.</p><p>He then started improving the UX, and in 3 months, they were successful in retaining customers.</p><p>Therefore, tracking KPIs can show you where your product’s lacking and how to improve it.&nbsp;</p><h3>#2. Highlights Gap</h3><p>If you want to make it big, you must know where your product lacks. But just knowing isn’t enough. That’s why tracking KPIs help to recognize the areas of improvement in your current business model.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if a startup comes to know it has a high burn rate, it can take steps in the right direction to cut off funding for secondary activities and reduce the burn rate over time.</p><h3>#3. Helpful for Investors</h3><p>Almost every startup needs funding to grow. And to impress your investors, you need to show the results. KPIs help you track results and show your investors the growth projections year-over-year.</p><p>Let’s say an investor asks you to present him your pitch.&nbsp;</p><p>They might want to look into revenue growth, cash burn, customer retention, and CAC. All these KPIs are important for them to know if the valuation you’re asking is fair or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you know the importance of KPI tracking for startups let's look at the most essential KPIs you should track.</p><div><br></div><h2>What Are the 10 Most Important KPIs You Should Track?</h2><p>Here’s what a couple of experts said us when we asked them what they track for their startups and scaleups:</p><p><strong>Expert #1:</strong></p><p><em>“We're still in the early stages at Contrast and in the Go-To-Market phase. We track the usual MRR, ARR, Churn rate and CAC by channel</em></p><p><em>At the beginning, we needed to be ""demo-led"" because the scope and value props in our product were evolving a lot. But as we are way more product-led now, we track a lot of value creation metrics like:</em></p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><em>Livestream scheduled</em></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><em>Number of time you went in the studio</em></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><em>Livestream done</em></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><em>Number of clips made out of the raw recording”</em></p></li></ul><p><strong>Expert #2:</strong></p><p><em>“We track KPIs like:</em></p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><em><strong>MRR: (Monthly Recurring Revenue) - does not include one-time, or nonrecurring revenue such as fees, etc.</strong></em></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><em><strong>ARR: (Annually Recurring Revenue) Measure of revenue components that are recurring in nature on an Annual Basis</strong></em></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><em><strong>Gross MRR Churn: Monthly recurring revenue lost in a given month / monthly recurring revenue at the beginning of the month</strong></em></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><em><strong>Paid CAC: Cost per Customer acquired through paid marketing channels (total sales and marketing spend in a given month / total customers acquired via paid channels, including via sales, in a given month)”</strong></em></p></li></ol><p>Here’s our expert opinion on what KPIs a startup should actually track.</p><h3>#1. Total Addressable Market (TAM)</h3><p>Total addressable market measures the target market a company is going for.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, it gives an idea about the revenue a company can generate by selling its product and services.</p><p>But why does it matter so much? Why do companies rely on that?</p><p><strong>Short answer </strong>- It gives you a roadmap for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us explain how:</p><p>Tracking the total addressable market helps you determine the marketing needs of your potential customers. That can save you both time and other resources like money and human resources in carving out a perfect plan to execute your business.</p><p>Turns out that you can make a better business plan and budget estimate by tracking and understanding TAM better than your competitors.</p><p>In addition, it lets you assess how strong the market for your business is so that you could focus on the product evolution and revenue growth eventually.</p><p>This brings us to another question, how do you calculate TAM?</p><p>You can calculate TAM in three steps:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Top-Down: Estimates TAM using industry reports and data studies</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Bottom-Up: Track projections based on your earlier sales</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Value Theory: Understand how much your product is worth to your ideal customer</strong></p></li></ol><h3>#2. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</h3><p>Recurring revenue is the life force of SaaS businesses. It’s the income expected by the number of active subscribers month-over-month.&nbsp;</p><p>In subscription-based businesses, it’s quite normal for customers to buy, pause, and cancel subscriptions regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if it remains untracked, the company fails to gauge its implications on the profit and overall revenue. That’s why monthly recurring revenue becomes essential for a business to measure the existing customer base.</p><p>Monthly recurring revenue is one of the most important metrics for SaaS companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Customers are the first and last indicators of a company’s success. And monthly recurring revenue paints a full picture of the customers who are joining and leaving your company (conversion rate).&nbsp;</p><p>By looking at MRR trends, you can know where your business is going and what you need to improve.</p><p>Moreover, it also helps to make accurate financial forecasting to decide what changes you need to make for increased monthly revenue.</p><p>Now that you know about the importance of MRR, you can calculate it by:</p><p><strong>MRR = </strong>Number of subscribers in the monthly plan X ARPU</p><p>Where,&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ARPU</strong> is the average rate per user.</p><h3>#3. Customer Churn Rate (CCR)</h3><p>Do you know how many customers are leaving you monthly or quarterly?</p><p>If you don’t, then you are unaware of its impact on the overall revenue and your business.&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, if you don’t address this without being too late, you won’t be able to fill those gaps and save your startup from hitting the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>Scary, right? 👻</p><p>Customer churn rate, aka customer attrition rate, is the percentage of customers leaving your business in a given time period.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be a tough realization for any business but a useful indicator of how your business is working out. The higher the churn rate, the more customers go out.</p><p>Customer churn rate can be an intimidating KPI to track, but it’s also a crucial one that lets you understand your customer better. By tracking it right, you can analyze the gap between your deliverability and customer expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>And then, you can find a way to narrow that gap by improving your product over time.</p><p>However, this KPI doesn’t answer why people are leaving, and that makes it difficult to make a more specific approach to solve the problem.</p><p>Yet, it’s always good to know the reason behind the attrition, which you can calculate by:</p><p><strong>CCR =</strong> (Customer in the beginning - Customers in the end) / Customers in the beginning</p><h3>#4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h3><p>An advertisement means nothing to a customer if it’s not engaging enough. Today, many startups online use highly targeted campaigns to approach customers and convert them into potential buyers.</p><p>Customer Acquisition Cost is a crucial business metric that refers to the overall cost spent by a company on the potential customer to buy something. The cost includes everything like</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Marketing efforts</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Inventory&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Production costs</p></li></ul><p>And much more…</p><p>The importance of CAC has risen, particularly in internet-based companies, to make educated business decisions. It’s how they figure out if their money brought value or not.</p><p>Additionally, it also takes a more pinpointed approach to growing your clientele. Traditional companies used a shotgun advertisement strategy that would appeal to a large segment of people.&nbsp;</p><p>On the contrary, by combining CAC with targeted campaigns, you not only bring in specific customers but also know how much you are spending on attracting them. This can channel a company's effort resulting in higher profitability.</p><p>You can calculate CAC by using this simple formula:</p><p><strong>CAC =</strong> Cumulative costs spent on acquiring new users / Number of customers acquired</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The lower the CAC, the higher the profit margins. Moreover, your investors would be keen to look at your CAC as it shows the amount you spend to acquire customers.</p><h3>#5. Average Revenue Per User</h3><p>When it comes to startup KPIs, ARPU is an underdog. But that doesn’t make it any less important.&nbsp;</p><p>It refers to the revenue generated from every active subscriber. It’s an indicator of how profitable a company is because it tells how much the average user spends per subscription.&nbsp;</p><p>As compared to MRR, it’s a more straightforward KPI to measure the net growth of a company.&nbsp;</p><p>ARPU can be useful in numerous ways.</p><p>For starters, it helps you analyze the pattern to distinguish between the best and worst performing products.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, it lets the company decide where it wants to spend more for maximum growth. This way, ARPU helps the company in making the right decision that has a direct impact on its scalability.</p><p>The formula for calculating the ARPU is:</p><p><strong>ARPU =</strong> Total revenue during a specific time / Active users during that time</p><p>ARPU helps you understand your potential buyers clearly, which results in better price models.</p><h3>#6. Monthly Active Users (MAU)</h3><p>How would you know if your product is good or not?</p><p>It’s simple; if people are using it repeatedly, then it’s worth some value.</p><p>Similarly, monthly active users refer to the number of users who have engaged with your product in some way during the last 30 days. It’s a commonly used metric in social media to measure the success of a campaign.</p><p>MAU provides an overview of general business health.</p><p>Tracking MAU has proven to be one of the key things for startup owners.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s because the number of active users indicates that the customers are interacting with your products which is a healthy sign and suggests you are on the right path.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, MAU trends tell you about the perceived value of your product so that you can make necessary changes if it’s working well.&nbsp;</p><p>Determining MAU over a period of time helps to evaluate the effectiveness of your marketing efforts. This guides you to create better strategies to drive more growth and an enriching customer experience.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, the calculation of MAU is slightly vague. Everyone has a different approach to calculating it.</p><p>Generally speaking, you can calculate MAU based on internet data. You can head to the platform where you track your website traffic and get an approximate MAU.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>If you’re in your early days, start tracking daily active users first (DAU).</p><h3>#7. Revenue Growth Rate</h3><p>In simple terms, the revenue growth rate is the rate at which the revenue has increased or decreased per month. It’s one of the most critical KPIs that indicates how quickly your startup is growing.</p><p>For example, if your startup’s first-month revenue is $1000 and it increases to&nbsp; $5000 in the second month, then the growth rate will be 400%.</p><p>Revenue growth encompasses everything, including sales, marketing, operations, etc. Thus it provides a comprehensive view of a startup’s growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, the revenue growth rate should not be confused with the earning growth, which is revenue minus the cost of production.</p><p>You can calculate the revenue growth by using this simple formula:</p><p>Revenue growth = (Current period revenue - Previous period revenue) / Previous period revenue</p><h3>#8. Monthly Burn</h3><p>As the term suggests, monthly burn refers to how fast a company is expected to burn all of its cash reserves before generating positive cash flows.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a common metric in modern-day startups that estimates how long they will burn their capital before they make any income.</p><p>For example, if the burn rate of a company is $5000, it means it spends $5000 cash in a month.</p><p>Tracking this can be useful in two ways:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Better financial understanding leads to smart business decisions in the future</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Knowing about the burn rate, startups can plan for further investment in advance</p></li></ul><p>Broadly, there are two types of burn rates:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Gross: </strong>Total operating expense of a company</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Net Burn rate:</strong> Amount earned and amount spend</p></li></ul><p>Here’s how to calculate both:</p><p><strong>Gross Burn Rate = </strong>(Monthly operating expense / Starting capital) X 100</p><p><strong>Net Burn Rate = </strong>(Revenue - Operating Expense / Startup Capital) X 100</p><h3>#9. Customer Lifetime value (LTV)</h3><p>Customer lifetime value refers to how much a business can benefit from a person's relationship with its brand. Roughly, it indicates how customers interact with your business.</p><p>CLV is a measurement of the overall customer relationship with the company and not just on a purchase basis. Though it boils down to assigning a single value to your customer, it has major benefits.</p><p>Firstly, it helps to serve your ideal customer base. Customer lifetime value indicates the amount of money customers will spend on your business over time.&nbsp;</p><p>That enables startup co-founders to develop a strategy to target those customers who will bring them maximum revenue directly.&nbsp;</p><p>That also helps to minimize the CAC, as once you know about CLV, you know where to put your maximum efforts to increase retention rate and spend less on acquiring new ones.</p><p>It’s always easier to serve old customers than to add new ones.&nbsp;</p><p>CLV identifies the specific customers that contribute most to your business. This allows you to retain them so that they stay with you for a longer time and spend more during that life cycle. This results in increased revenue over time.</p><p>By now, we have understood the importance of CLV. Let’s now look at how to calculate it:</p><p><strong>CLV =</strong> Customer Value X Avg. customer lifespan</p><p>Where,&nbsp;</p><p>Customer value = Average purchase value X Average number of purchases</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> CLV is an incredible metric that tells you where your loyal customers are so that you can maximize your outcome by focusing on them.</p><h3>#10. Return on Investment (ROI)</h3><p>Simply investing in your business is not enough. You need to find out what you’re getting out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Return on investment means how much profit or loss you make on an investment. It can be defined as the net profit divided by the total investment costs.</p><p>ROI is a useful KPI when you have to judge your performance and come to a concrete solution.&nbsp;</p><p>It analyzes and determines the profitability of the investments. Calculating ROI is the best way to measure your financial gains and investment returns.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, it also highlights a business's weak spots, which pushes you to shape a stronger strategy to achieve higher efficiency.</p><p>ROI is simple to calculate, you can get that by:</p><p><strong>ROI =</strong> (Net profit / Investment) X 100</p><p>You can rely on ROI data to evaluate and understand how a particular investment worked for your business.

Generally based on the area of the business we think needs the most attention or is least optimized in the funnel. I agree that it is important to stay focused and choose one or two parts of the funnel and dedicate the quarterly metrics and resources to that part.”</em> - Natalie Marcotullio (Head of Growth and Operations at <a href=""https://www.navattic.com/"">Navattic</a>)</p><p>Knowing what KPIs to track for a startup is often tricky and a crucial part of the process. If you make the wrong decisions in the initial phase, you will waste a significant amount of time tracking KPIs that aren't worth it.</p><p>Here’s what Leah Tharin (Product lead at <a href=""https://smallpdf.com/"">Smallpdf</a>) said when we interviewed her:</p><p>“When your startup is in a non-monetized phase, track KPIs like the number of users, the target market, and the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>At the initial stage of your startup your goal might be to track the number of users you can onboard on your platform. But if you’re a B2B business, it might also be important to ensure that you have the right customers.&nbsp;</p><p>To know this, you can do a sub-segmentation of your audience. This means instead of just saying that you want to onboard 100,000 users till the end of the year, ensure that 30,000 of those should be small businesses (or a segment that you think is a must-have target market for your product).</p><p>Lastly, keep KPI tracking simple for startups and don’t go into much detail or spend most of your time tracking them because it's still early days.”</p><p>Here’s what <a href=""https://datapad.io"">Datapad’s</a> co-founder John Ozuysal has to say about tracking KPIs for startups:</p><p><em>“If you’re in the early stage try to tackle one thing at a time and set your KPIs around that main metric. If you’re working on your marketing funnel, try to go after one part of the funnel in a quarter. Go after acquisition if that is your goal and track KPIs around this.”</em></p><div><br></div><h2>How to Track Your Startup KPIs with Datapad?</h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/xjbteUUxufGDoJU5d6zDpYg43xo.png""><p>Datapad is a mobile-first KPI tracking app (available for both Android and iOS) that lets you create KPI dashboards, bring your team onboard, and track your KPIs on the go.</p><h3>Step 1: Setting Up Goal on Datapad</h3><p>As a startup, you should start the KPI tracking process by defining your goals with every KPI you want to track.</p><p>You can do that easily with Datapad. Here’s a GIF to show you how it's done.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/scecjBjvbyrjUP84cJPqmxa4A.gif""><p>Do the above process for all the KPIs you want to track and keep track of the progress weekly, monthly, or quarterly, as per your needs.</p><h3>Step 2: Setting Up a Dashboard</h3><p>Setting up a dashboard on Datapad takes just a few seconds. You can click on <strong>‘Create a Dashboard,’</strong> fill out the details for your KPI, add a touch of personalization, and click on <strong>‘Create.’</strong></p><p>That’s it; your brand new dashboard is on your phone screen.</p><img alt=""dashboard setup to track startup kpis"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/ROggj4n3h3ySyXQT9ASbdUUv6c.gif""><h3>Step 3: Import Data Automatically or Add KPIs Manually</h3><p>To track any KPI, you need data around it. If you want to track website traffic progress, you need to know what your traffic was on day one and what’s the traffic now.</p><p>And to get this kind of data, you need to import it from the platform that helps you track it (in the case of the above example, it’s Google Analytics).</p><p>With Datapad, you can import data automatically with several one-click integrations we provide. Or you can even enter a KPI manually if you have less data that you’ve been tracking manually.</p><p>Along with importing data, you can also add KPI details, set goals, and customize the color according to your brand.</p><p>To import data automatically, the app has a button -<strong> Use a data source</strong>. Here’s how to use it:</p><img alt=""add metrics from integrations"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/KLEyZ57aUcKQqbAg53Cx6iqfSOI.gif""><p>But if you’re planning to manually enter the KPI, you can just use our <strong>‘Enter Manually’ </strong>option.</p><img alt=""enter metrics manually"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/1bfQMWCtcyAK2dDm9VxVlgtQB4Y.gif""><h3>Step 4: Onboard Your Team</h3><p>Onboarding your team to track KPI should be your first step as a startup. That’s because when every person in your team knows how the startup’s doing, they’d be able to think out of the box and suggest ideas that’d increase KPI performance.</p><p>Here’s how to onboard your team with Datapad:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Click on Datapad’s logo (top left-hand side of the screen)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Go to Manage users</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Click on the<strong> ‘+’</strong> sign on the top right-hand side corner</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Enter the email address of your team member and tap invite users</p></li></ul><img alt=""invite your team members from datapad"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oD3Wv0dnLHN9qfuMpahcmFdhtI.gif""><h3>Step 5: Monitor Your KPIs and Get Updated with Notifications&nbsp;</h3><p>What good is tracking KPIs if you have no idea what’s going on, right?</p><p>Datapad gives you real-time and push notifications wherever a KPI underperforms or overperforms.</p><p>Not just this, every KPI you track has a comment section just below it that lets you chat with your team around the KPI wherever you want.</p><p>Datapad is a KPI tracking app that saves a boatload of time as you have all your KPIs in your pocket! 😀</p><p>All entrepreneurs can get started for free - no credit card required.

High-Entry Cost</h3><p>ThoughtSpot does not offer a free plan. The most basic plan is priced at $1250 per month. Compared to other BI and analytics tools pricing, ThoughtSpot has a high entry cost. High enough to make individual users, startups, and small businesses look for cost-effective options.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Consumption-Based Pricing</h3><p>ThoughtSpot's consumption-based pricing model lets you purchase a ThoughtSpot subscription based on <strong>credit or time usage</strong> of the ThoughtSpot product.&nbsp;</p><p>The variable nature of consumption-based pricing can make it difficult for small businesses to budget effectively, as costs can fluctuate based on usage.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/czeYWOGTRP37bJgvAILXCZvVLA.png""><p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/13n2vn8/comment/jl1tklx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"">Source</a></p><h3>3. Lacks Transparency</h3><p>If you value transparent pricing, ThoughtSpot might not be a great fit for you. Many users express concerns about the lack of transparency in pricing. The costs associated with different plans are complex and not clearly communicated upfront, making it difficult to budget accordingly.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/knZRDLvmBASgRdcEUBihYPDqE.png""><p><a href=""https://www.g2.com/products/thoughtspot/reviews/thoughtspot-review-7807660"">Source</a></p><h2>ThoughtSpot Essential Plan</h2><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/x2LVXNnMkYpEiBvOeUk5mpBrM.png""><p>The ThoughtSpot Essential plan is a subscription-based offering that provides access to ThoughtSpot's core analytical capabilities.</p><p>It's designed for teams and organizations looking to leverage the power of search-driven analytics with basic usage limits and without extensive customization or advanced features.</p><p>With the Essential plan, you can add a <strong>maximum of 20 users</strong> and <strong>up to five user groups</strong>, access <strong>25 million data rows</strong>, and <strong>1 million AI search suggestions</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>👀 Note:</strong> Search suggestions are counted for each query asked to AI, regardless of the output.

It is expensive for larger enterprises and companies as well because of consumption-based pricing. As usage expands, pricing increases significantly.</p><p>Based on Vendr's <a href=""https://www.vendr.com/buyer-guides/thoughtspot"">internal data</a>, the average annual cost for ThoughtSpot is around $140,000.

Wondering how you can track business KPIs to stay on top of things?</p><p>Everyone in the business world knows that KPIs are important. But when asked why they are important or how to get the most out of them, people often have little to no idea.</p><p>If you’re one of them, don’t worry, we’re here to clear the why and how of key performance indicators (KPIs).</p><p>This guide will cover what a KPI is, the difference between KPIs and OKRs, the types of KPIs, and many more things you should know about them before tracking them.</p><p>So let’s get started.</p><h2>What is a KPI?&nbsp;</h2><img alt=""what is kpi"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/bjN4tLmQO0ieewYMnRvOd5v4.png""><p>KPI (key performance indicator) is a quantifiable measure of business performance and measures how a team, project, or overall department performs.&nbsp;</p><p>It's measured by comparing performance against set goals and objectives. Measuring KPI isn't just a vital process for any business; it also helps potential investors decide whether to invest in your business or not.&nbsp;</p><p>In simple terms, KPI is a goal that you work towards achieving. For example, your goal for 2022 might be to <strong>'Get 500 new customers for your product.'&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Therefore, the KPI to track here is the <strong>‘Number of New Customers Acquired.’</strong></p><p>Like the example above, there are numerous KPIs that you might want to measure for different departments of your business <em>(more on this later)</em>.</p><p>But first, let’s see why you should measure KPIs in the first place.</p><h2>Why is KPI Important for Your Business?&nbsp;</h2><p>Businesses don’t track KPIs for no reason. There are several benefits of tracking KPIs. Let’s look at the top reasons why a business would measure them.</p><img alt=""4 reasons why kpis are important"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/sDUAGhh9qKezkCy0PBApf49174E.jpeg""><h3>Reason #1. Boosts Employee Morale</h3><p>The primary reason why a business tracks KPIs is to know about the performance of everyone in the organization.&nbsp;</p><p>But that’s not it!&nbsp;</p><p>Many companies also track KPIs along with their team to make them feel motivated.</p><p>Imagine sharing the number of sales calls every sales rep in your team booked and commending them for the same.</p><p>How happy and motivated your sales rep will be!</p><p>This also boosts employee morale and motivates them to do better next month.</p><p>To kick things up a notch, you can set milestones for your team and incentivize them upon achieving them.</p><h3>Reason #2. Helps You Track Business Objectives</h3><p>As mentioned in the previous point, the primary goal of tracking KPIs is to track business performance, meaning tracking business objectives.</p><p>Setting objectives, goals, and milestones for any business is crucial, and keeping track of them is even more important.</p><p>Key performance indicators help you drill down data, compare it with business objectives, and know how many objectives you set are met and which ones need to be worked on.</p><h3>Reason #3. Determines Business’s Strengths and Weaknesses</h3><p>Are you aware of the SWOT analysis? For those of you who aren't aware, SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) is a technique that summarizes all major aspects of any business.</p><p>By doing a SWOT analysis on each and every KPI you track, you can know about your business’s strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Suppose you track NPS and the average score of the survey for March comes out to be negative. This means your customers aren't getting satisfied with the product.</p><p>Here’s how you can do a SWOT analysis for NPS KPI and know about your business’s strengths and weaknesses.</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Strength: </strong>Segregate all the promoters and see what they like about your product</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>Segregate all the detractors and see what are your customer's pain points</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Look for how you can improve your product features and satisfy customers</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Threats: </strong>Look at the reviews and see if any of your customers mention a competitor's name</p></li></ul><p>Doing such calculations will help you determine where to improve and put your most effort.&nbsp;</p><h3>Reason #4. Analyzes Historical Trends and Patterns Over Time</h3><p>If you have a huge database, tracking KPIs can help you analyze trends and patterns that form over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Every aspect of business, be it revenue, cart abandonment, or employee satisfaction, has a specific trend. When we say trend, we mean that there might be a certain pattern that a KPI might repeat after a specific time.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you have an eCommerce website that sells winter wear in the US, most of your sales might occur in the winter season, and for the rest of the year, you might see minimal sales. You will observe this every year, and it becomes a trend.</p><p>Analyzing historical trends and patterns will help you plan things well in the future and be ready for a slow or hyperfast market.</p><p>Many people confuse KPIs with OKRs, but they’re not the same. Here’s the difference between them.</p><h2>KPIs vs. OKRs: What are the Differences?&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-vs-okrs"">KPIs and OKRs</a> are two completely different chapters of the same book- <em>performance measurement</em>. While they might overlap in some places, each is set out for a unique purpose.</p><p>Let’s start with KPIs.</p><h3>What are KPIs?</h3><p>Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are a set of measurements used to gauge the overall performance of your business. A KPI is always set to provide numeric targets for organizational goals.</p><p>Simply put, KPIs are meant to demonstrate your business's health.</p><p>In most companies, KPIs are tracked daily, monthly, or quarterly. There are a few selective KPIs that might be tracked yearly.</p><h4>KPI Example</h4><p>Suppose a SaaS-based company aims to decrease its Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by 15% in 3 months. This sounds like a SMART goal; it's specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.</p><p>Therefore, the KPI to track here is customer acquisition cost (CAC).</p><p>Tracking this KPI monthly can help you identify what strategies are working and which aren’t. Moreover, you get access to crucial insights such as:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Prominent sources of acquiring customers</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Performance of marketing campaigns</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Close rate of sales calls</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Cost per lead</p></li></ul><p>And much more.</p><p>Adding quantifiable measurements makes your hefty data easily understandable and effectively comparable with whatever you measure.</p><h3>What are OKRs?</h3><p>Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are metrics that align company or team <strong>'objectives' </strong>alongside <strong>'key results.'</strong> Unlike key performance indicators that are generally steady, OKRs are aggressive, bold, and reserved for big-picture goals.&nbsp;</p><p>If we put out a one-liner - OKR is a strategic framework within which KPIs act as a set of measurements.</p><p>Typically, OKRs reflect areas of improvement (strategic objectives) for your business. It measures <strong>'key results'</strong> that track the impact of changes and modifications made by your team on the set KPI targets.</p><h4>OKR Example</h4><p><strong>Marketing Team OKRs</strong></p><p><strong>Objective: </strong>Increase brand recognition and awareness</p><p><strong>Key Results</strong></p><p>KR#1: Launch customer referral program by 1st December</p><p>KR#2: Increase the number of content shares on Instagram from 20 to 80</p><p>KR#3: Leverage UGC (User-generated content) for better word-of-mouth marketing</p><p>KR#4: Increase click-through rate by 30% by Q4</p><p>Let's get to the bottom line here.&nbsp;</p><p>KPIs and OKRs are bound towards attaining organizational goals, but a thin line differentiates them during the action.</p><img alt=""kpis vs okrs"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/SqXZKqJlRsYNrDQ7JwVlFc1BFkk.png""><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Key Performance Indicators</strong></p><p><strong>Objectives and Key Results</strong></p><p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p>Measure progress and business health</p><p>A goal-setting methodology that lets you set and measure goals</p><p><strong>Scope</strong></p><p>Identifies leading and lagging indicators (compare past performance to reflect future goals)</p><p>Future-focused and directional</p><p><strong>Nature</strong></p><p>Steady-state; act as benchmark for day-to-day operations</p><p>Aggressive and bold; directed towards achieving the impossible</p><p><strong>Time-Frame</strong></p><p>Measured monthly, quarterly or yearly</p><p>Measured on an ongoing basis</p><h2>11 Types of KPIs You Should Be Aware of</h2><img alt=""types of kpis"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/MOsgH9tZVO91R9WYuOj9ZhW4bWI.png""><h3>#1. Quantitative KPIs</h3><p>As the name suggests, quantitative KPIs are the types you can measure. They have a specific formula to calculate, and the result is either a number, fraction, percentage, or ratio.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Examples: </strong>Monthly revenue, cart abandonment rate, monthly email signups.</p><h3>#2. Qualitative KPIs</h3><p>Unlike quantitative KPIs, you don’t get a measurable number when you track a qualitative KPI. Your results might be a graph or in text form.&nbsp;</p><p>By tracking qualitative KPIs, you could know if it has a positive or negative impact on your business, but you can't know exactly how much impact it has.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong> Customer reviews, survey results, etc.</p><h3>#3. Leading Indicators</h3><p>Businesses track leading KPIs or indicators to know about future trends and forecasting. These KPIs help you and your business draw a long-term road map for the company. Leading indicators can be any long-term goal you have in mind.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong> Improve your app’s experience, decrease website bounce rate, etc.</p><h3>#4. Lagging Indicators</h3><p>Lagging indicators is something you can only know after a certain business process is completed.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike leading indicators, you can't predict or calculate the outcome for lagging KPIs. But with these, you can surely decipher a pattern that's occurring over time.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if the unemployment rate in your company has been increasing for the past 3 months, there are high chances it will increase in the 4th month as well.</p><h3>#5. Input Indicators</h3><p>Every business has multiple processes running, and for every process, you need resources. Input indicators are those resources that go into each project so that you get the intended outcome.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Your sales team is an input indicator to sell your product.</p><h3>#6. Output Indicators</h3><p>Output indicators are the exact opposite of input indicators. These indicators reflect the final result of the KPI you might be calculating. With output indicators, you come to know if a specific business process is a success or not.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong> Monthly recurring revenue, number of customers acquired, customer acquisition cost, etc.</p><h3>#7. Process Indicators</h3><p>A business tracks process indicators to gauge the overall performance of a process. And if the process doesn’t perform as expected, these indicators can help you fix it as well.</p><p><strong>Examples: </strong>KPIs like support tickets raised, tickets resolved, response time etc., are the process indicators for your business's customer service department.</p><h3>#8. Practical Indicators</h3><p>Practical indicators are the ones you can leverage to know about the specificity of any project or business process when it's still running. With practical indicators, you can predict how the process will end and if the outcome will be favorable or not.</p><p>These indicators vary with the type of process a business runs.</p><p>For example, a business that runs PPC campaigns might see CAC or CTR as practical indicators.</p><h3>#9. Directional Indicators</h3><p>Directional indicators help you gauge your company’s performance against set benchmarks or competitors. You can also use them to spot, analyze, and rectify trends.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> One directional indicator that most companies use is time on site. It's the time your company's developer or technical assistant spends fixing bugs and troubleshooting problems for your client on-site. An increased time on site is often considered bad for a business.</p><h3>#10. Actionable Indicators</h3><p>Actionable indicators are the set of KPIs that come into the picture after all the processes you're running for your business have ended, and it's now time to optimize them.&nbsp;</p><p>Meaning these indicators help you optimize business processes, thus increasing business performance.</p><h3>#11. Financial Indicators</h3><p>As the name suggests, financial indicators show where your business finances are at. In layman's terms, these indicators show your business's financial performance.&nbsp;</p><p>When clubbed with other KPIs, financial indicators bring out the bigger picture and show you where your business is overspending or underspending.</p><h2>What are the 5 Main KPIs to Track?</h2><h3>#1. For Business Owners</h3><img alt=""kpis for business owners"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/fq8xtMewera9PjmJMZx2bRYOIq4.png""><p>If you’re a business owner, you might often fall short on time and prefer tracking KPIs that heavily impact your business operations.</p><p>These KPIs will use the most resources of your company but, at the same time, deliver the most impactful results.</p><p>Some of the KPIs that a business owner must track are:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Gross Profit Margin: </strong>The amount of money left after paying the cost of goods sold, manufacturing costs, worker costs, and all other expenses</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Revenue Growth Rate:</strong> The rate at which your company’s revenue is growing</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Inventory Turnover Rate: </strong>Number of units sold in a given period of time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Customer Retention: </strong>The number of customers who bought from your repeatedly in a set period of time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Quick Ratio: </strong>The ability of your company to pay off debts with cash or near-cash assets you have right now</p></li></ul><h3>#2.

So tracking KPIs for every channel is crucial.</p><p>The KPIs marketers should track will depend on the type of processes the team runs, but here are the most significant <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/12-b2b-marketing-kpis-every-business-owner-should-track-in-2022"">marketing KPIs</a>:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Cost Per Acquisition: </strong>The total marketing spend to get a new customer</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Customer Lifetime Value: </strong>The total money spent by a customer in their lifetime on your website</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Return On Investment (Marketing): </strong>The ratio between the revenue generated and the amount spent on marketing campaigns</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Traffic-to-Lead Ratio: </strong>The number of visitors that converted into a hot or cold lead over a period of time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Lead-to-Customer Ratio:</strong> Total number of qualified leads that the marketing team successfully converted into customers</p></li></ul><h3>#3.

For Operations</h3><img alt=""kpis for operatons"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/gYSBiRoiFv0Akr2pqDTxd6fqub8.png""><p><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpis-for-operations"">Operation KPIs</a> are a broader niche of metrics that your chief operating officer or you as a CEO can track and know how every process in your business is performing in real time. Tracking KPIs for operations becomes vital for decision-making.</p><p>Here are some KPIs that your COO or you as a CEO can take initiative to track:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Cash Conversion Cycle:</strong> The time taken for a business to convert its inventory into cash</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Throughput:</strong> A manufacturing operations KPI that tells you about the capability of your plant to produce new products</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Click-Through Rate:</strong> A marketing operations KPI that gives you the ratio of impressions to click on any of your campaigns</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Sales Cycle Length: </strong>A sales operation KPI that gives you the average time taken to close one deal with a customer</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Absenteeism Rate: </strong>A human resource operation KPI that tells you about the number of days an employee didn’t work in a month or year</p></li></ul><h2>3 KPI Examples</h2><h3>KPI #1. Gross Profit Margin</h3><p>Gross profit margin measures the profit earned from the sale of goods and services after deducting the cost of goods sold.</p><p>The two main factors determining gross profit are revenue and COGS (cost of goods sold).</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Down the lane, it's better to know whether your product is profitable or not - and gross profit tells you exactly this.</p><p>This KPI signals whether your sales and production processes are running efficiently. A low gross profit indicates that you’re incurring higher COGS. This means you must work through the production and operational processes to cut costs.</p><p>Here's the defined formula to calculate the gross profit margin:</p><p><em>GPM = {(Total revenue - COGS) / Total revenue} X 100</em></p><h3>KPI #2. Customer Retention Rate</h3><p>Customer Retention Rate (CRR) refers to the number of customers who repeat purchases from your business over a specific time period.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Retaining existing customers is economical in all ways because:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Acquiring a new customer is 5X costlier</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Existing customers comparably <a href=""https://www.gallup.com/workplace/311870/customer-centricity.aspx"">spend more</a> on your store or website</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Building a loyal customer base is good for referral sales</p></li></ul><p>A higher CRR is a prolific indicator of customer-centric culture and policies. Besides, a happy customer is always a promoter of your business.</p><p>Here's how you can measure your customer retention rate:</p><p><em>CRR = {(E-N)/S} X 100</em></p><p>Where,</p><p>E = Customer at the end of the period</p><p>N = New customers added during the period</p><p>S = Customers at the start of the period</p><h3>KPI #3. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)</h3><p>Customers are the whole and soul of your business, and you ought to ensure their happiness.</p><p>This KPI is popularly used by businesses to measure the satisfaction level of customers after interacting with their products or services.</p><h4>Why Is It Important?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, successful brands like Amazon and Apple prioritize customer experience over anything else. And it's nothing you can’t do as well.</p><p>You can share feedback forms or surveys with customers to measure your customer satisfaction score.&nbsp;</p><p>These surveys have a scale from 0 to 5, or, even better, they include three options, namely 'Very Satisfied' (4-5), 'Satisfied' (3), and 'Not Satisfied (0-2).</p><p>Now, to calculate CSAT, take the data of customers who voted 4 &amp; 5 and place it in the below formula:</p><p><em>CSAT = Number of 4 &amp; 5 respondents / Total no. of respondents X 100</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-examples""><strong>KPI Examples: Here Are the Best 30 You Can Find in 2022</strong></a></p><h2>How Can You Use KPIs in Your Business?&nbsp;</h2><img alt=""how to use kpis in your business"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/phafKrJbZs8QGzx1dhDDvV2CQ.png""><h3>Step #1. Identify Key Goals of Your Business and Use KPIs to Track Them</h3><p>The first and foremost thing to do in a business is to list down your short and long-term goals.</p><p>Setting strategic goals for marketing, sales, finance, etc. helps you keep track of things and stay on top of your business. But tracking business goals isn’t possible without tracking KPIs.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, for every attainable goal you set, have at least one KPI you can track and know how close you are to achieving the set goal.</p><p>For example, if your goal is to <em><strong>‘Get 100 new sign-ups in November,’</strong></em> the ideal KPI to track here is the <em><strong>‘number of sign-ups.’ </strong></em>Other supporting KPIs might be conversion rate, bounce rate, CAC, and many more.</p><h3>Step #2. Get an Overall View of All Business Operations by Using a KPI Dashboard Software</h3><p>In the last point, we said to set specific goals and track relevant KPIs. But how will you track these KPIs?&nbsp;</p><p>You can’t just manage everything on Google Sheets. It might work initially, but when you have a larger customer base and a lot of processes going on, tracking KPIs on Google Sheets will become a nightmare.</p><p>Instead, use a KPI dashboard software like <a href=""https://www.datapad.io/"">Datapad</a> to track KPIs on the go.</p><img alt=""datapad kpi dashboard software"" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/Tt1oG4BHysi9iYsmD1LEac8tg4.png""><p>With dashboarding software like Datapad, you can create dashboards in seconds, import data automatically or manually, and track KPIs from your mobile phone.</p><p>Along with this, you can do so much with Datapad:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Bring your team onboard by sending them email invites</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Communicate with your team via the live comment section below every KPI</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Assign every team member a KPI and set goals for them</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Search KPIs via Datapad’s search bar feature</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Import data from popular data sources with our 1-click integrations</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customize your dashboards to match your brand’s color scheme</p></li></ul><p>And the list goes on…</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Datapad is meant for business owners who're short on time and want to glance at the KPIs quickly. It's not an ideal dashboarding software for drilling down on data.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step #3. Drill Down on KPIs and Make Data-Driven Decisions</h3><p>Where Datapad helps business owners and managers get a quick glance at business KPIs, some software like <a href=""https://www.tableau.com/"">Tableau</a>, <a href=""https://www.metabase.com/"">Metabase</a>, <a href=""https://redash.io/"">Redash</a>, etc. helps your team drill down on data and get in-depth insights about a specific KPI.</p><p>It's important for your team to understand the reason behind the under or overperformance of a KPI they track.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s because if they don’t know the reason, they might not be able to optimize the processes they run to make your business profitable.</p><h2>5 Things to Avoid When Setting Up Your KPIs</h2><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>📏 Don't Measure Everything You See:</strong> A common mistake entrepreneurs make is to measure every data they hold.

However, choosing the ones that best align with business objectives and goals is crucial.</p><p>Let’s examine a few examples of KPIs and how to calculate them:&nbsp;</p><h4>Example #1. Profit Margin</h4><p>Profit margin gives you the measure of the total sales revenue is profit, which is critical for the financial health of your business.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, calculating a profit margin of a product will tell you whether it’s worth selling or not.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Businesses with a wide selection of products must closely monitor their profit margins to price their products correctly.</p><p>Generally speaking, there are two types of profit margins:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Net Profit Margin: </strong>Money left after all expenses and income</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Gross Profit Margin: </strong>Profit left after accounting for the cost of goods sold (COGS)</p></li></ul><p>The formulas for both these profit margins are as follows:</p><p><strong>Net Profit Margin =</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) X 100</p><p><strong>Gross Profit Margin = </strong>[(Total Revenue - COGS) / Total Revenue] X 100</p><h4>Example #2. Employee Turnover Rate</h4><p>Employee Turnover Rate gives you the percentage of employees who leave your company within a set period of time. The KPI encompasses both involuntary and voluntary separation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did You Know: </strong>Retaining your employees is cheaper than hiring new ones?&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""https://www.thehrdigest.com/cost-of-employee-turnover-vs-retention-proposition/"">According to The HR Digest</a>, to hire a fresh candidate, you’d end up spending money equivalent to one-third of their salary.</p><p>So if you're looking to hire a developer at a salary of $90,000 per year, you'd spend approximately $30,000 in just the hiring process.</p><p>The average employee turnover rate worldwide in 2021 was 47.2%.</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/6tId1UV3dkWYza2AUiEbXapsM.png""><p><a href=""https://www.award.co/blog/employee-turnover-rates"">Source</a></p><p>If you’re getting employee retention rates &lt; 45% for your company, this means your employees aren’t satisfied working with you (generally speaking).</p><p>Here’s the formula to calculate employee turnover rate:</p><p><strong>Employee Turnover Rate =</strong> (Employees left in the company / Average number of employees) X 100</p><h4>Example #3. Conversion Rate</h4><p>Conversion rate is the percentage of times a prospect performs a desired action such as making a purchase, clicking on an ad, submitting their contact information, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Analyzing conversions helps businesses to identify issues with their marketing or sales process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conversion Rate = </strong>(Number of conversion / Total visitors) X 100</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=""https://www.datapad.io/blog/kpi-examples""><strong>KPI Examples: Here Are the Best 30 You Can Find in 2022</strong></a></p><h3>KPI Use Cases: Sales, Marketing &amp; Customer Success</h3><p>From sales and marketing to finance, KPIs help every area of a business move forward. Here are the three use cases you might want to use KPIs for.</p><h4>#1. Sales</h4><p>Sales KPIs are metrics used to measure the effectiveness of your employees and sales department.&nbsp;</p><p>A sales executive might be evaluated based on their ability to generate a certain number of monthly sales bookings or opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>A sales manager could be evaluated by the total sales volume produced by their team.&nbsp;</p><p>Essential sales KPIs to track:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Number of monthly onboarding and demo calls booked</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Call volume per sales rep</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Sales per rep</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Average cost per lead</p></li></ul><h4>#2. Marketing</h4><p>Marketing KPIs track your return on marketing investment (ROMI). You can track these KPIs to determine whether their marketing campaigns and activities are generating leads or customers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, an ecommerce store needs to know its customer acquisition cost (CAC). This metric tells you how much it costs to acquire a new customer.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the marketing team knows how much they can spend on advertising to acquire customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Essential marketing KPIs to track:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Digital marketing ROI</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Lead-to-customer ratio</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Landing page conversion rate</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Organic traffic</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)</p></li></ul><h4>#3. Customer</h4><p>Customer KPIs can tell you a great deal about your product and customer experience.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s world, customer experience is everything. And why shouldn’t it be, as customers are the ones who’d pay to use your services or products.</p><p>Tracking customer KPIs helps you understand what type of customers are not satisfied with your product and why. The same if true for you employees, you can set up an employee feedback program to measure employee satisfaction.</p><p>As Jeff Bezos once said:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It’s our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.”</em></p><p>Customer KPIs to track:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Average response time</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customer lifetime value (CLV)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Net promoter score (NPS)</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Bounce rate</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p>Customer effort score</p></li></ul><h2>What Is a KRA? Definition &amp; Benefits</h2><p>A key responsibility area (KRA) is a structure that describes the role of a particular job profile.&nbsp;</p><p>KRAs summarize the optimum results expected from employees, teams, and the entire organization. They help employees understand their role and provide a sense of direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's why KRAs are vital to your business's success:&nbsp;</p><ul><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Evaluate Employee Performance: </strong>Excellent performance management method to evaluate employee performance fairly. You can see whether they're performing their responsibilities and whether it's driving the desired result you're looking for.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Ensures Time Efficiency: </strong>KRA uses the Pareto Principle, which states that 20% of activities drive 80% of results. By focusing on the key responsibilities that drive results, employees will use their time more wisely and become more productive.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Helps with Resource Management: </strong>Organizations can better allocate resources once the roles are clearly defined. For example, after tracking KRAs, companies have a better idea of how many new hires are needed, what type of technology or software employees need, and potential training material to kick things off.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=""p""><p><strong>Improves Employee Engagement: </strong>KRAs help employees see the bigger picture of how their role helps the entire organization. Also, KRAs can be personalized to each employee, which gives them a sense of autonomy on how they can personally achieve success within the company.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3>Top 3 KRA Examples for Key Roles</h3><p>Let's cover some KRA examples so that you can visually see how KRAs and KPIs complement one another:&nbsp;</p><h4>Example #1: Sales Manager&nbsp;</h4><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/EqgS1GsZhGMkWpHPmSbfPxWpI.png""><h4>Example #2: Human Resource Manager</h4><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/oX8F2ZoXJOTuoI9uW6FTpFHqRY.png""><h4>Example #3: Marketing Manager</h4><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/xvaiGCaFofnSF5owCzUzNT04nk.png""><h3>KRA Use Cases: Onboarding, Check-Ins &amp; Software Tools</h3><p>Knowing about KRAs is one thing, but knowing how to implement them is also important.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few use cases for how to communicate your KRAs to your employees:&nbsp;</p><h4>#1. Onboarding</h4><p>Once an employee is hired for a role, their natural inclination is to learn what is expected and how they can succeed in their role.&nbsp;</p><p>Setting the right strategic objectives using KRAs helps your recruiter convey the required information to the candidate and makes the expectations clear.</p><h4>#2. 1:1 Check-In or Team Meetings</h4><p>1:1 check-ins and team meetings are the perfect time to provide feedback. Employees are<a href=""https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238064/re-engineering-performance-management.aspx""> 3.6 times</a> more engaged than other employees when managers involve them in goal setting.&nbsp;</p><h4>#3. Use Software</h4><p>Software can easily store and maintain a record of each employee’s KRAs. You can personalize each team member’s performance management goals and accurately evaluate their performance over time.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal when creating KRAs is to determine the purpose of every position in each department. It’s also done to answer questions like - why are each position and staff member employed by the organization?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Using KRAs the Right Way:</strong> Figure out the key results every employee must achieve and then create a list of vital tasks they need to perform to achieve each result.&nbsp;</p><h2>KRA vs. KPI: 6 Key Differences Explained</h2><p>KPI and KRA are both vital to a company's overall success. They complement one another and help your team to accomplish their goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's break down the key differences between the two.&nbsp;</p><h3>#1. Definition</h3><p>KRAs describe the scope of the job role, which details the result that the position must provide. From there, key tasks can be assigned to achieve the goal.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas KPIs measure the progress that an employee is making toward their KRA. It's important to note that KPIs are quantifiable measures, while KRAs are qualitative.&nbsp;</p><h3>#2. Process&nbsp;</h3><p>KPIs can't be set unless there's a clear objective in mind. That's where KRAs come in. KRAs are aligned to the organization's objective. Each job position plays an integral part in achieving the mission statement and vision of the company.&nbsp;</p><p>KPIs track the progress of an employee/customer towards a set KRA. Therefore, when setting business goals, KRA comes first.&nbsp;</p><h3>#3. Measurability</h3><p>KRAs aren't easily measurable, which is why KPIs a business needs KPIs.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a sales manager with a KRA to develop an effective sales team can be quite subjective. The KPI that measures sales growth and total sales tells you whether the sales manager's team is improving or not.&nbsp;</p><p>However, KRAs are needed because assigning the wrong KPIs can lead to wrong outcomes. The key is to set realistic KPIs and only assign a select few. This helps keep employees focused on only the key metrics that drive results.&nbsp;</p><h3>#4. Structure&nbsp;</h3><p>Multiple KPIs can be assigned to a single KRA. But the opposite isn’t true.</p><p>A marketing manager with a KRA to achieve a successful marketing campaign can attribute multiple KPIs to measure success.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, they might track conversion rate, profit margin, cost per customer acquisition, number of new leads or customers, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, a single KPI can't tell the entire story. For example, a website might get a lot of traffic but very few conversions. This means there's something wrong with the conversion rate KPI.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the marketing manager might adjust the copy, improve the offer or target a more refined audience to ensure better conversion. The higher conversion will ultimately lead to more sales.&nbsp;</p><h3>#5. Timeline</h3><p>KRAs are typically a standard that a job role strives to achieve. It's designed to be a long-term quarterly or yearly assessment. That's because the job scope rarely changes every month.&nbsp;</p><p>However, KPIs can be quickly adjusted from month to month based on the circumstances. In this aspect, KPIs are more fluid. For example, a minor budget cut will alter the available marketing spend, which changes all of the KPIs.&nbsp;</p><h3>#6. Basis&nbsp;</h3><p>KRAs are based on your organization's missions and aspirations. They are created based on the grand vision of the company. A company that values customer service will set KRAs related to ensuring customer satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>While KPIs align with the company's mission, they can often change based on past results. KPIs will frequently be adjusted based on factors such as the employee's past performance, quarterly goals, resource allocation, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, KRAs describe more aggressive and bolder strategic goals, while KPIs act as benchmarks each employee should hit. KPIs ultimately lead to achieving the desired result.&nbsp;</p><img alt="""" src=""https://framerusercontent.com/images/xQxYkJIUGNiwW4yXdWRsZQZ7a48.png""><h2>Keep All Business KPIs in Your Pocket with Datapad</h2><p>KRAs and KPIs make a dynamic duo and act as the drivers of success for any business.
