## Prerequisites

<FeatureItem>**Google Cloud Project** - An active Google Cloud project with BigQuery enabled and dataset access</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**BigQuery Datasets** - Datasets with tables containing your analysis data in BigQuery</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**IAM Permissions** - BigQuery Data Viewer role or custom permissions for read access</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Service Account** - Google Cloud service account with appropriate BigQuery permissions</FeatureItem>

## Connection Methods

Choose the authentication method that fits your Google Cloud setup.

### Service Account Key
Use a service account JSON key file for secure API access.

### OAuth 2.0
Use OAuth authentication for individual user access.

### Google Cloud IAM
Connect using Google Cloud Identity and Access Management roles.

## Connection Guide

### Step 1: Access BigQuery Integration

Navigate to Integrations in Datapad and select Google BigQuery:

### Step 2: Set Up Google Cloud Authentication

Create a service account in Google Cloud Console:

![Google Cloud service account setup](/images/docs/bigquery-service-account.png)

**Required Steps:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console â†’ IAM & Admin â†’ Service Accounts
2. Create a new service account
3. Grant BigQuery Data Viewer role
4. Generate and download JSON key file

<InfoItem>Keep your service account key file secure and never share it publicly. This key provides access to your BigQuery data.</InfoItem>

### Step 3: Configure BigQuery Connection

Enter your Google Cloud project and authentication details:

![BigQuery connection form](/images/docs/bigquery-form.png)

**Required Fields:**
- Google Cloud Project ID
- Service Account Key File
- Default Dataset (optional)
- Query Location/Region

### Step 4: Select Datasets and Tables

Choose which BigQuery datasets you want to analyze:

![BigQuery dataset selection](/images/docs/bigquery-datasets.png)

**Selection Options:**
- All Datasets (for comprehensive analysis)
- Specific Datasets (for focused analysis)
- Table-level permissions (for granular control)

## Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask once your BigQuery data is connected:

<StepItem>"What's our customer acquisition cost trend across all marketing channels this year?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"How do user engagement metrics vary by geographic region and device type?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Which product features drive the highest user retention and revenue?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Show me our sales funnel conversion rates by traffic source and campaign?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What's the lifetime value distribution across our customer segments?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"How does seasonal demand affect our inventory and supply chain metrics?"</StepItem>

### ðŸ’¬ Big Data Tips

<TipItem>Include dataset and table names for precise targeting in large data warehouses</TipItem>
<TipItem>Use date partitioning references to optimize query performance and costs</TipItem>
<TipItem>Ask about clustering keys and optimization for better query efficiency</TipItem>
<TipItem>Request cost analysis to understand and optimize BigQuery spending</TipItem>

## Behind the Scenes

Datapad connects to Google BigQuery using the BigQuery API and generates optimized SQL queries that take advantage of BigQuery's columnar storage, partitioning, and clustering features. Our AI understands BigQuery-specific functions, cost optimization strategies, and performance best practices to provide fast, cost-effective analytics from your big data warehouse.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication failed
If BigQuery authentication fails:
- Verify your service account key file is valid and not expired
- Check that the service account has BigQuery Data Viewer permissions
- Ensure the Google Cloud project ID is correct
- Try creating a new service account key

### Permission denied errors
If you get permission errors:
- Verify the service account has access to the specific datasets
- Check that BigQuery API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
- Ensure IAM roles are properly assigned at the project or dataset level
- Contact your Google Cloud admin for additional permissions

### Query performance issues
If queries are running slowly or timing out:
- Check BigQuery query execution details for optimization opportunities
- Verify that tables are properly partitioned and clustered
- Consider query optimization or slot reservation for better performance
- Monitor BigQuery job history for performance patterns

### Cost optimization
If BigQuery costs are higher than expected:
- Review query patterns and suggest more efficient alternatives
- Check for full table scans that could benefit from partitioning
- Consider using clustered tables for better query performance
- Set up query cost monitoring and alerts in Google Cloud Console
