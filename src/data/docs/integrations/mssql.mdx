## Prerequisites

<FeatureItem>**SQL Server Instance** - A running SQL Server instance (2016 or higher) with your data</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Database Access** - SQL Server login or Windows Authentication with read permissions</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Network Access** - Database should be accessible from the internet or through VPN/tunnel</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**SSL Certificate** - SSL encryption for secure data transmission (recommended)</FeatureItem>

## Connection Methods

Choose the authentication method that fits your SQL Server configuration.

### SQL Server Authentication
Use SQL Server username and password authentication.

### Windows Authentication
Use Windows Authentication for integrated security.

### Azure SQL Database
Connect to Azure SQL Database with connection strings.

## Connection Guide

### Step 1: Access SQL Server Integration

Navigate to Integrations in Datapad and select Microsoft SQL Server:

### Step 2: Enter Connection Details

Fill in your SQL Server connection information:

![SQL Server connection form](/images/docs/mssql-form.png)

**Required Fields:**
- Server Name/Instance
- Port (default: 1433)
- Database Name
- Authentication Method
- Username and Password
- Encryption Settings

<InfoItem>For Azure SQL Database, use the fully qualified server name (server.database.windows.net).</InfoItem>

### Step 3: Configure Security Settings

Select encryption and security options:

**Security Options:**
- SSL Encryption (recommended)
- Trust Server Certificate
- Connection Timeout
- Command Timeout

### Create Read-Only Login (Recommended)

For security, create a dedicated login with read-only permissions:

```sql
-- Create a new login for Datapad
CREATE LOGIN datapad_readonly WITH PASSWORD = 'SecurePassword123!';

-- Create user in your database
USE your_database;
CREATE USER datapad_readonly FOR LOGIN datapad_readonly;

-- Grant read permissions
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER datapad_readonly;

-- Grant view definition for metadata access
GRANT VIEW DEFINITION TO datapad_readonly;
```

<WarningItem>Replace "your_database" with your actual database name and use a strong password that meets your organization's security requirements.</WarningItem>

## Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask once your SQL Server data is connected:

<StepItem>"Show me the top performing sales representatives this quarter"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What's our inventory turnover rate by product category?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"How many support tickets were resolved each day this month?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Which departments have the highest budget utilization?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Show me year-over-year revenue growth by region"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What's the average processing time for customer orders?"</StepItem>

### ðŸ’¬ Enterprise Query Tips

<TipItem>Include schema names for precise targeting (e.g., "Sales.Orders table")</TipItem>
<TipItem>Use business terminology that aligns with your database naming conventions</TipItem>
<TipItem>Ask about stored procedure results and views for complex business logic</TipItem>
<TipItem>Request performance analysis for query optimization insights</TipItem>

## Behind the Scenes

Datapad connects to your SQL Server database using secure protocols and generates optimized T-SQL queries that leverage SQL Server-specific features like CTEs, window functions, and advanced analytics. Our AI understands SQL Server's unique syntax and performance characteristics to provide fast, efficient database analysis.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection failed
If SQL Server connection fails:
- Verify SQL Server is configured to accept remote connections
- Check that TCP/IP protocol is enabled in SQL Server Configuration Manager
- Ensure the SQL Server Browser service is running (for named instances)
- Test connectivity using SQL Server Management Studio

### Authentication error
If authentication fails:
- Verify login credentials are correct and account is active
- Check if the login has access to the target database
- Ensure Windows Authentication is properly configured (if using)
- Try connecting with SQL Server Management Studio using same credentials

### Firewall and network issues
If network connection fails:
- Verify SQL Server port (usually 1433) is open in firewall
- Check that SQL Server is listening on the correct IP address
- Ensure no network security groups are blocking connections
- Test network connectivity using telnet or similar tools

### Permission errors
If you get permission-related errors:
- Verify the user has db_datareader role in the target database
- Check that VIEW DEFINITION permissions are granted for metadata access
- Ensure the user can access system views needed for schema analysis
- Contact your DBA if additional permissions are required
