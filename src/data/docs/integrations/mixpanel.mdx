<StepItem>"How do user retention rates vary by acquisition channel and user properties?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What feature usage patterns correlate with increased user engagement?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Which user segments should I target for re-engagement campaigns?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"How can I optimize my conversion funnel to increase activation rates?"</StepItem>

### ðŸ’¬ User Analytics Tips

<TipItem>Focus on user journey analysis rather than individual event counts</TipItem>
<TipItem>Ask about cohort behavior differences to identify successful user patterns</TipItem>
<TipItem>Request predictive analysis for user churn and lifetime value</TipItem>
<TipItem>Use property-based segmentation for personalized user experience insights</TipItem>

## Behind the Scenes

Datapad connects to the Mixpanel Export API to fetch your event data, user profiles, and funnel analytics. Our AI analyzes user behavior patterns, identifies key moments in the user journey, and provides specific recommendations for improving user engagement, reducing churn, and increasing revenue per user through data-driven product and marketing strategies.

## Troubleshooting

### Authorization failed
If Mixpanel authorization fails:
- Verify your API secret is correct and hasn't been regenerated
- Check that your project token matches your Mixpanel project
- Ensure API access is enabled in your Mixpanel project settings
- Try generating new API credentials if the current ones aren't working

### Missing event data
If event data is missing or incomplete:
- Verify events are being properly tracked and sent to Mixpanel
- Check that event names and properties match your tracking implementation
- Ensure the date range includes periods with sufficient user activity
- Confirm events aren't being filtered out by Mixpanel's data retention settings

### Data sync issues
If data synchronization is slow or failing:
- Check your Mixpanel project's rate limits and API usage
- Verify your data region setting matches your Mixpanel project
- Ensure stable internet connectivity for data transfer
- Contact support if specific events or time periods appear to be missing

### Limited user insights
If user behavior analysis seems limited:
- Verify you have sufficient user volume for statistical significance
- Check that user properties and events provide meaningful segmentation
- Ensure proper user identification and tracking across sessions
- Consider expanding event tracking for more comprehensive behavior analysis
