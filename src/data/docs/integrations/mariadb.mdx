## Prerequisites

<FeatureItem>**MariaDB Database** - A running MariaDB instance (version 10.3 or higher) with your data</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Database Credentials** - Host, port, database name, username, and password with read access</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Network Access** - Database should be accessible from the internet or through VPN/SSH tunnel</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**SSL Certificate** - SSL encryption for secure data transmission</FeatureItem>

## Connection Methods

Choose the connection method that best fits your security requirements and infrastructure setup.

### Database Connection Form
Connect directly using your database credentials with SSL encryption.

### Connection String
Use a MariaDB connection string with SSL encryption.

### SSH Tunnel
Connect through an SSH tunnel for maximum security.

## Connection Guide

### Step 1: Access MariaDB Integration

Navigate to Integrations in Datapad and select MariaDB:

### Step 2: Fill Connection String

Enter your MariaDB database connection string:

![MariaDB connection string form in Datapad](/images/docs/mariadb-cs.png)

**Required Fields:**
- Connection Name
- Connection String
- Database Schema

<StepItem>The MariaDB connection string format is: mariadb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME</StepItem>

### Step 3: Fill Connection Details

Enter your MariaDB database connection details:

**Required Fields:**
- Database Host
- Port (default: 3306)
- Database Name
- Username
- Password
- SSL Mode

### Create Read-Only User (Recommended)

For security, create a dedicated user with read-only permissions:

```sql
-- Create a new user for Datapad
CREATE USER 'datapad_readonly'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';

-- Grant connect permission to the database
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'datapad_readonly'@'%';

-- Grant select permissions on specific database
GRANT SELECT ON your_database.* TO 'datapad_readonly'@'%';

-- Apply the changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

<WarningItem>Replace your_database with your actual database name and choose a strong password for the datapad_readonly user.</WarningItem>

## Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask once your MariaDB data is connected:

<StepItem>"Show me the top 10 customers by revenue this month"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What's the average order value by customer segment?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"How many new users signed up each day this week?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Which products have the highest profit margin?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Show me monthly revenue growth for the last year"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What's our customer retention rate by cohort?"</StepItem>

### ðŸ’¬ Natural Language Tips

<TipItem>Be specific about time periods ("last 30 days", "this month vs last month")</TipItem>
<TipItem>Include table names when possible ("orders table", "users table")</TipItem>
<TipItem>Ask for comparisons to get more insights ("compare X vs Y")</TipItem>
<TipItem>Use business terms that align with your data schema</TipItem>

## Behind the Scenes

Datapad automatically converts your natural language questions into optimized MariaDB SQL queries. You can always view the generated SQL to learn and verify the results, including MariaDB-specific functions and performance optimizations.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection timeout
If the connection times out:
- Check firewall settings and whitelist Datapad IPs
- Verify the host and port are correct
- Ensure MariaDB is accepting connections
- Test connectivity from your network

### Authentication failed
If authentication fails:
- Verify username and password are correct
- Check if the user has access to the database
- Ensure user can connect from external hosts ('%' wildcard)
- Try connecting with the same credentials using mariadb client

### SSL connection issues
If SSL connection fails:
- Verify SSL is enabled on your MariaDB server
- Check if you have valid SSL certificates
- Try different SSL modes (REQUIRED, PREFERRED, DISABLED)
- Contact support for help with certificate issues
