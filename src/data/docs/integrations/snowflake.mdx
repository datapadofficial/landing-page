## Prerequisites

<FeatureItem>**Snowflake Account** - An active Snowflake account with access to your data warehouse</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Database Access** - Read permissions on databases, schemas, and tables you want to analyze</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Connection Details** - Account URL, warehouse name, and authentication credentials</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Network Access** - Snowflake account accessible from Datapad (usually automatic for cloud)</FeatureItem>

## Connection Methods

Choose the authentication method that fits your organization's security requirements.

### Username/Password
Standard authentication using Snowflake username and password.

### SSO Integration
Single Sign-On integration for enterprise security and convenience.

### Key Pair Authentication
Use RSA key pair authentication for enhanced security.

## Connection Guide

### Step 1: Access Snowflake Integration

Navigate to Integrations in Datapad and select Snowflake:

### Step 2: Enter Connection Details

Fill in your Snowflake connection information:

![Snowflake connection form](/images/docs/snowflake-form.png)

**Required Fields:**
- Account URL (e.g., your-account.snowflakecomputing.com)
- Username
- Password or Authentication Method
- Warehouse Name
- Database Name
- Schema Name (optional)

<InfoItem>Your Snowflake account URL can be found in your Snowflake console under Account settings.</InfoItem>

### Step 3: Configure Warehouse Settings

Select compute warehouse and resource settings:

![Snowflake warehouse configuration](/images/docs/snowflake-warehouse.png)

**Warehouse Options:**
- Existing Warehouse (recommended)
- Warehouse Size Preference
- Auto-suspend Settings
- Query Timeout Limits

### Create Read-Only Role (Recommended)

For security, create a dedicated role with read-only permissions:

```sql
-- Create a role for Datapad
CREATE ROLE datapad_readonly;

-- Grant database and schema usage
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE your_database TO ROLE datapad_readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA your_database.your_schema TO ROLE datapad_readonly;

-- Grant select permissions on tables
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA your_database.your_schema TO ROLE datapad_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA your_database.your_schema TO ROLE datapad_readonly;

-- Grant warehouse usage
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE your_warehouse TO ROLE datapad_readonly;

-- Create user and assign role
CREATE USER datapad_user PASSWORD = 'secure_password';
GRANT ROLE datapad_readonly TO USER datapad_user;
```

<WarningItem>Replace database, schema, and warehouse names with your actual names. Use a strong password for the datapad_user account.</WarningItem>

## Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask once your Snowflake data is connected:

<StepItem>"What's our revenue trend by month for the last year?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Show me the top 10 customers by total spend across all regions"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"How does our conversion rate vary by traffic source and campaign?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What's the average customer lifetime value by cohort?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Which products have the highest profit margins this quarter?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Show me daily active users trend with seasonality analysis"</StepItem>

### ðŸ’¬ Data Warehouse Tips

<TipItem>Include database and schema names for precise targeting</TipItem>
<TipItem>Ask about data lineage and relationships between tables</TipItem>
<TipItem>Request performance analysis to optimize your queries</TipItem>
<TipItem>Use business metrics that align with your data warehouse structure</TipItem>

## Behind the Scenes

Datapad connects to your Snowflake data warehouse using secure connections and generates optimized SQL queries that take advantage of Snowflake's cloud architecture. Our AI understands Snowflake-specific functions, performance optimizations, and best practices to provide fast, cost-effective analytics from your data warehouse.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection timeout
If Snowflake connection times out:
- Verify your account URL is correct and accessible
- Check that your warehouse is running and available
- Ensure network connectivity to Snowflake cloud
- Try increasing connection timeout settings

### Authentication failed
If authentication fails:
- Verify username and password are correct
- Check that the user account is active and not locked
- Ensure the user has access to the specified database and warehouse
- Try logging in directly to Snowflake console with same credentials

### Insufficient privileges
If you get privilege errors:
- Verify the user has SELECT permissions on target tables
- Check that USAGE permissions are granted on database and schema
- Ensure the user can access the specified warehouse
- Review role assignments and privilege inheritance

### Query performance issues
If queries are running slowly:
- Check warehouse size and consider scaling up for better performance
- Review query complexity and suggest optimizations
- Ensure proper clustering and indexing on frequently queried columns
- Contact support for query optimization assistance
