## Prerequisites

<FeatureItem>**Oracle Database** - Oracle Database 12c or higher with your enterprise data</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Database Access** - Oracle user account with read permissions and connect privileges</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Network Access** - Database accessible through TNS listener or direct connection</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem>**Oracle Client** - Oracle client libraries for secure connectivity</FeatureItem>

## Connection Methods

Choose the connection method that fits your Oracle infrastructure.

### TNS Connection
Connect using TNS names and Oracle Net Services configuration.

### Direct Connection
Direct connection using host, port, and service name.

### Oracle Cloud
Connect to Oracle Autonomous Database or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

## Connection Guide

### Step 1: Access Oracle Integration

Navigate to Integrations in Datapad and select Oracle Database:

### Step 2: Enter Connection Details

Fill in your Oracle connection information:

![Oracle connection form](/images/docs/oracle-form.png)

**Required Fields:**
- Host/Server Name
- Port (default: 1521)
- Service Name or SID
- Username
- Password
- Connection Type (TNS/Direct)

<StepItem>For Oracle Cloud Autonomous Database, use the connection string from your cloud console.</StepItem>

### Step 3: Configure Advanced Settings

Set Oracle-specific connection options:

**Advanced Options:**
- SSL/TLS Encryption
- Connection Pool Settings
- Query Timeout
- Schema Selection

### Create Read-Only User (Recommended)

For security, create a dedicated user with read-only permissions:

```sql
-- Create a new user for Datapad
CREATE USER datapad_readonly IDENTIFIED BY "SecurePassword123!";

-- Grant basic connection privileges
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO datapad_readonly;

-- Grant read access to specific schemas
GRANT SELECT ON your_schema.your_table TO datapad_readonly;
-- Or grant read access to all tables in a schema
GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO datapad_readonly;

-- Grant access to system views for metadata
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TABLES TO datapad_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TAB_COLUMNS TO datapad_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_CONSTRAINTS TO datapad_readonly;

-- For Oracle 12c+ container databases
ALTER USER datapad_readonly SET CONTAINER_DATA=ALL;
```

<WarningItem>Replace schema and table names with your actual objects. Use strong passwords that meet Oracle security requirements and your organization's policies.</WarningItem>

## Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask once your Oracle data is connected:

<StepItem>"Show me the top revenue-generating products across all business units"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What's our quarterly financial performance by region and division?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"How many transactions are processed per hour during peak times?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Which customers have the highest lifetime value in the enterprise segment?"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"Show me supply chain efficiency metrics by supplier and location"</StepItem>
<StepItem>"What's the trend in operational costs over the last fiscal year?"</StepItem>

### ðŸ’¬ Oracle Query Tips

<TipItem>Include schema names for precise targeting in complex enterprise environments</TipItem>
<TipItem>Use Oracle-specific analytical functions for advanced calculations</TipItem>
<TipItem>Ask about hierarchical queries and recursive data structures</TipItem>
<TipItem>Request performance analysis using Oracle execution plans</TipItem>

## Behind the Scenes

Datapad connects to your Oracle database using Oracle's native connectivity protocols and generates optimized Oracle SQL that leverages advanced features like analytical functions, hierarchical queries, and Oracle-specific performance optimizations. Our AI understands Oracle's enterprise features and generates queries that take advantage of Oracle's powerful analytical capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection failed
If Oracle connection fails:
- Verify the Oracle listener is running and accepting connections
- Check that the TNS names configuration is correct
- Ensure the Oracle client libraries are properly installed
- Test connectivity using SQL*Plus or Oracle SQL Developer

### TNS resolution errors
If TNS name resolution fails:
- Verify the tnsnames.ora file contains the correct service definition
- Check that the ORACLE_HOME and TNS_ADMIN environment variables are set
- Ensure the Oracle Net Services are properly configured
- Try using a direct connection instead of TNS names

### Authentication failed
If authentication fails:
- Verify the username and password are correct
- Check if the user account is locked or expired
- Ensure the user has CREATE SESSION privilege
- Try connecting with Oracle SQL Developer using the same credentials

### Performance issues
If queries are running slowly:
- Check Oracle execution plans for query optimization opportunities
- Verify that proper indexes exist on frequently queried columns
- Consider using Oracle hints for query optimization
- Monitor Oracle AWR reports for system performance analysis

### Privilege errors
If you encounter privilege errors:
- Verify the user has SELECT permissions on target tables and views
- Check that system view access is granted for metadata queries
- Ensure proper role assignments for read-only access
- Contact your Oracle DBA for additional privilege grants if needed
