<TipItem>Use predictive analysis to identify future opportunities and risks</TipItem>

## Behind the Scenes

Datapad connects to your Metabase instance via the Metabase API to access dashboard data, question results, and metadata. Our AI analyzes patterns across your dashboards, identifies correlations between metrics, and provides strategic insights that help you understand the story your data is telling and what actions to take based on dashboard trends.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection failed
If Metabase connection fails:
- Verify your Metabase instance URL is correct and accessible
- Check that the API key is valid and hasn't expired
- Ensure Metabase is running and responsive
- Test connectivity using the same URL and credentials in a browser

### Authentication error
If authentication fails:
- Verify the API key has the necessary permissions
- Check that the username/password combination is correct (if using session auth)
- Ensure the user account has access to the required dashboards and collections
- Try generating a new API key if the current one isn't working

### Missing dashboard data
If dashboard data is incomplete:
- Verify the selected dashboards contain data and are not empty
- Check that underlying data sources are properly connected in Metabase
- Ensure dashboard questions are properly configured and executing
- Contact support if specific dashboards or metrics appear to be missing

### Performance issues
If data sync is slow:
- Check your Metabase instance performance and resource usage
- Verify network connectivity between Datapad and your Metabase instance
- Consider optimizing complex Metabase questions for better performance
- Adjust sync frequency settings if real-time updates aren't critical
