faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between a good and bad query?"
    answer: "Good queries are specific, include time periods, and use clear business language. For example, 'Show monthly revenue for Q4 2024 by product category' is much better than just 'show sales.' Bad queries are vague, lack context, or use technical jargon that the AI might misinterpret."
  - question: "How specific should I be in my natural language queries?"
    answer: "Be as specific as possible while remaining natural. Include the exact metric (revenue vs profit), time frame (last month vs Q3), and any filters (by region, product, etc.). The more context you provide, the more accurate and useful your results will be."
  - question: "Can I ask multiple questions in one query?"
    answer: "It's better to focus on one main question per query for clearer results. If you need related information, use follow-up questions or break complex requests into smaller, focused queries. This helps the AI provide more accurate and actionable insights."
  - question: "What should I do if the AI doesn't understand my question?"
    answer: "Try rephrasing using different business terms, break complex questions into smaller parts, or use the suggested question prompts. You can also be more specific about time periods, metrics, or add more context about what you're trying to achieve."

## Effective Query Structure

### The What + When + Where Formula

The most effective queries follow a simple three-part structure that ensures comprehensive and actionable results:

<StepItem title="WHAT (Metric)">Clearly state what you want to measure - revenue, conversions, customer count, traffic, engagement, or any other specific business metric.</StepItem>

<StepItem title="WHEN (Time Period)">Specify the exact time frame for analysis - "last month", "this quarter", "year over year", or specific dates like "January 2024".</StepItem>

<StepItem title="WHERE (Segment)">Define filters and segments - by channel, campaign, product, region, customer type, device, or traffic source.</StepItem>

**Example:** "Show me **revenue** (WHAT) **for last month** (WHEN) **broken down by marketing channel** (WHERE)"

<StepItem title="Complete Context">This formula ensures your query has all the necessary context for the AI to provide accurate, actionable insights that directly support business decisions.</StepItem>

## Good vs. Bad Query Examples

Understanding what makes a query effective is easier when you see examples side by side. Here are common scenarios with improvements:

### Revenue Analysis

**❌ Too Vague:** "Show sales"
- Missing time period and context
- Which sales? When? How grouped?

**✅ Clear & Specific:** "Show monthly sales revenue for Q4 2024, broken down by product category"
- Clear metric, specific time period, useful segmentation

### Customer Analysis

**❌ Unclear Intent:** "Customer data"
- What about customers? Count? Value? Behavior?

**✅ Action-Oriented:** "List the top 20 customers by lifetime value, showing their first purchase date and total orders"
- Specific output, clear ranking criteria, relevant context

### Marketing Performance

**❌ Missing Context:** "How are campaigns doing?"
- Which campaigns? What metrics define "doing well"?

**✅ Measurable Outcome:** "Compare Google Ads vs Facebook Ads ROAS for the last 30 days, including click-through rates and conversion rates"
- Specific channels, clear metrics, defined time frame, comparative analysis

<WarningItem title="Avoid Ambiguity">Vague queries lead to vague results. Always include specific metrics, time frames, and context to get actionable insights.</WarningItem>

## Query Templates by Use Case

### Performance Analysis

**Trend Analysis Template:**
"Show [metric] trend over the last [time period], comparing to [previous period]"

**Top Performers Template:**
"List top [N] [items] by [metric] for [time period]"

**Growth Rate Template:**
"Calculate [metric] growth rate from [start date] to [end date]"

### Comparative Analysis

**Channel Comparison Template:**
"Compare [metric] across [channels/segments] for [time period]"

**Before vs After Template:**
"Compare [metric] before and after [event/date]"

**Segment Performance Template:**
"Show [metric] breakdown by [segment] for [time period]"

### Customer Insights

**Customer Value Template:**
"Calculate average [metric] per customer for [segment] in [time period]"

**Retention Analysis Template:**
"Show customer retention rate by [cohort/segment] over [time period]"

**Acquisition Trends Template:**
"Analyze new customer acquisition by [source/channel] for [time period]"

### Time-Based Analysis

**Seasonal Patterns Template:**
"Show [metric] by [month/quarter] for the last [N] years"

**Day-of-Week Template:**
"Compare [metric] by day of week for [time period]"

**Hourly Patterns Template:**
"Show [metric] by hour of day for [specific days/period]"

<TipItem title="Template Usage">Use these templates as starting points, then customize with your specific metrics, time periods, and business context for optimal results.</TipItem>

## Advanced Query Tips

### Use Follow-up Questions

Start broad, then drill down based on initial results to uncover deeper insights and root causes.

**Example Flow:**
1. "Show revenue by channel" 
2. "Why did social media revenue drop 20%?" 
3. "Which social campaigns underperformed?"

### Include Context for Better Analysis

Mention relevant business events, campaigns, or external factors that might influence your data interpretation.

**Example:** "Show website traffic during our Black Friday promotion period (Nov 20-30, 2024)"

### Request Specific Visualizations

Tell the AI how you want to see the results for better presentation and understanding.

**Example:** "Show quarterly revenue growth as a line chart with percentage change annotations"

<StepItem title="Iterative Analysis">The best insights often come from asking follow-up questions. Start with a broad query, then dig deeper based on what you discover.</StepItem>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Do This
- Ask multiple unrelated questions in one query
- Use technical database terminology
- Forget to specify time periods
- Ask for "everything" without focus
- Use ambiguous terms like "good" or "bad"

### Do This Instead
- Focus on one main question per query
- Use business language your team understands
- Always include relevant time frames
- Specify the most important 3-5 metrics
- Define success criteria with numbers

<WarningItem title="Question Overload">Asking too many questions at once often leads to incomplete or confusing results. Break complex requests into focused, sequential queries.</WarningItem>

## Quick Reference Checklist
