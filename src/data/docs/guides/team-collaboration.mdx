  - question: "How do I set up different permission levels for my team?"

  - question: "Can I share dashboards with people outside my organization?"
    answer: "Yes, you can share dashboards with external stakeholders using time-limited public links or by inviting them as Viewers with specific dashboard access. Always use filtered views to show only relevant data and set expiration dates for security."
  - question: "How do automated reports work with team collaboration?"
    answer: "You can schedule reports to be automatically sent to specific team members or groups via email, Slack, or Teams. Recipients don't need Datapad accounts to receive reports, and you can customize the content and frequency for different audiences."
  - question: "What's the best way to organize shared content for a large team?"
    answer: "Create team folders organized by department or project, use clear naming conventions, establish documentation for dashboard usage, and set up role-specific dashboards. Regular training sessions help ensure everyone knows how to find and use shared resources effectively."
