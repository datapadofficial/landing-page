faqs:
  - question: "How does AI identify relationships between different data sources?"
    answer: "The AI analyzes field names, data types, and content patterns to identify potential relationships. It uses fuzzy matching for similar but not identical fields, temporal matching for time-based relationships, and probabilistic matching to suggest connections with confidence scores."
  - question: "Is my data secure during the blending process?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Data blending happens through secure API connections without moving or duplicating your source data. All processing occurs in real-time within your secure environment, ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection regulations."
  - question: "What if the AI suggests incorrect data relationships?"
    answer: "You can review and approve all suggested relationships before they're applied. The system provides confidence scores for each suggestion, and you can override or customize any relationships that don't match your business logic."
  - question: "Can I blend real-time and historical data?"
    answer: "Yes! Data blending works with both real-time streaming data and historical datasets. You can combine live website analytics with historical sales data, or merge current social media metrics with past campaign performance for comprehensive analysis."
