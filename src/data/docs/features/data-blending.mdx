faqs:
  - question: "How does AI identify relationships between different data sources?"
    answer: "The AI analyzes field names, data types, and content patterns to identify potential relationships. It uses fuzzy matching for similar but not identical fields, temporal matching for time-based relationships, and probabilistic matching to suggest connections with confidence scores."
  - question: "Is my data secure during the blending process?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Data blending happens through secure API connections without moving or duplicating your source data. All processing occurs in real-time within your secure environment, ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection regulations."
  - question: "What if the AI suggests incorrect data relationships?"
    answer: "You can review and approve all suggested relationships before they're applied. The system provides confidence scores for each suggestion, and you can override or customize any relationships that don't match your business logic."
  - question: "Can I blend real-time and historical data?"
    answer: "Yes! Data blending works with both real-time streaming data and historical datasets. You can combine live website analytics with historical sales data, or merge current social media metrics with past campaign performance for comprehensive analysis."

## Intelligent Data Unification

Data Blending transforms isolated data sources into a unified, comprehensive view of your business. By automatically identifying relationships and connections across platforms, you can finally see the complete customer journey and business performance picture.

<FeatureItem icon="merge" title="Automatic Relationship Detection">AI algorithms analyze your data structures and automatically identify common fields, entities, and relationships across different platforms without manual configuration.</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem icon="puzzle" title="Smart Data Matching">Advanced matching algorithms connect related records even when field names, formats, or structures differ between systems.</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem icon="eye" title="Holistic Insights">Discover insights that are impossible to see when data remains siloed - understand true customer lifetime value, complete attribution, and cross-channel performance.</FeatureItem>

## How Data Blending Works

### Automatic Schema Discovery
When you connect multiple data sources, our AI analyzes each platform's data structure:

- **Field Analysis**: Identifies similar data types and potential matching fields
- **Entity Recognition**: Recognizes customers, products, campaigns, and other business entities
- **Relationship Mapping**: Suggests connections between related data points
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for suggested relationships

### Intelligent Data Matching
The system uses multiple matching strategies to connect related records:

- **Exact Matches**: Direct field matches (email addresses, IDs, timestamps)
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Similar but not identical values (name variations, address formats)
- **Temporal Matching**: Time-based relationships (events, sessions, campaigns)
- **Probabilistic Matching**: Statistical likelihood of record relationships

### Unified Data Models
Creates virtual unified datasets without moving or duplicating your source data:

- **Customer 360**: Complete customer profiles across all touchpoints
- **Product Performance**: Product metrics from inventory, sales, and marketing
- **Campaign Attribution**: Multi-touch attribution across advertising platforms
- **Revenue Operations**: End-to-end revenue cycle analysis

<InfoItem title="Data Privacy">Data blending happens in real-time through secure connections. Your data never leaves its original source, ensuring privacy and compliance.</InfoItem>
