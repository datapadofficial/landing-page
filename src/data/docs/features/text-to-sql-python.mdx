## Code Generation Capabilities

### SQL Query Generation
Transform business questions into sophisticated database queries:

- **Complex Joins**: Multi-table relationships handled automatically
- **Window Functions**: Advanced analytics like running totals and rankings
- **Aggregations**: Group-by operations with intelligent filtering
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexed queries that run efficiently

### Mongo Aggregation Generation
Transform business questions into sophisticated mongo aggregations:
![mongo aggregation](/images/docs/features/mongo-aggregation.png)


### Python Script Creation
Generate statistical analysis and data manipulation code:
![python script](/images/docs/features/python-script.png)

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and transformations
- **Statistical Modeling**: Regression, classification, and clustering algorithms
- **Visualization**: Professional charts with matplotlib and seaborn
- **Time Series**: Forecasting and trend analysis

<StepItem title="Code Quality">All generated code includes comments explaining the logic, making it educational and maintainable for your team.</StepItem>

## Real-World Examples

### Business Intelligence Queries
**Question**: "Show me percentage of users with email with .edu extension in it"

**Generated SQL**:
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
    product_category,
    SUM(revenue) as monthly_revenue,
    LAG(SUM(revenue)) OVER (
        PARTITION BY product_category 
        ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
    ) as previous_month_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY month, product_category
ORDER BY month DESC, monthly_revenue DESC;
```

### Statistical Analysis
**Question**: "How many users in our database has a .edu extension in their emails?"

**Generated Python**:
```python
# Get the users dataset
dataset = [ds for ds in existing_datasets if ds.dataset_id == '68b819eee96e2fa1686a319e'][0]
df = dataset.data

# Filter for users with .edu email extensions
edu_users = df[df['email'].str.contains(r'\.edu$', case=False, na=False)]

# Count total .edu users
edu_count = len(edu_users)
total_users = len(df)

# Create summary dataframe
summary_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Category': ['Users with .edu emails', 'Total users', 'Percentage with .edu'],
    'Count': [edu_count, total_users, f"{(edu_count/total_users)*100:.2f}%"]
})

print(f"Users with .edu email extensions: {edu_count}")
print(f"Total users: {total_users}")
print(f"Percentage: {(edu_count/total_users)*100:.2f}%")

# Show some examples of .edu emails if any exist
if edu_count > 0:
    print("\nExamples of .edu email addresses:")
    print(edu_users[['display_name', 'email']].head(10))

computed_dataframe.append(summary_df)
```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Language Support
The AI can generate code in multiple languages and formats:

- **SQL Dialects**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **MongoDb Aggregations**: For mongo databases

### Code Optimization
Every generated query and script is optimized for performance:

- **Query Planning**: Efficient execution paths and index usage
- **Memory Management**: Optimized data loading and processing
- **Vectorization**: Efficient operations on large datasets
- **Error Handling**: Robust code that handles edge cases
