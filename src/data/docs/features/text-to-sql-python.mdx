## Transform Business Questions Into Code

The Text2SQL & Python feature represents the future of data analysis, where technical barriers disappear and anyone can harness the full power of databases and statistical programming through natural conversation.

<FeatureItem icon="code" title="Intelligent Code Generation">Our AI understands the nuances of both SQL and Python, generating optimized, production-ready code that follows best practices and performs efficiently.</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem icon="database" title="Database Expertise">Get the equivalent of a senior database administrator's knowledge instantly - complex joins, window functions, and optimized queries generated from simple questions.</FeatureItem>
<FeatureItem icon="trending-up" title="Statistical Programming">Access advanced Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn without needing to learn their syntax or methods.</FeatureItem>

## Code Generation Capabilities

### SQL Query Generation
Transform business questions into sophisticated database queries:

- **Complex Joins**: Multi-table relationships handled automatically
- **Window Functions**: Advanced analytics like running totals and rankings
- **Aggregations**: Group-by operations with intelligent filtering
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexed queries that run efficiently

### Python Script Creation
Generate statistical analysis and data manipulation code:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and transformations
- **Statistical Modeling**: Regression, classification, and clustering algorithms
- **Visualization**: Professional charts with matplotlib and seaborn
- **Time Series**: Forecasting and trend analysis

<InfoItem title="Code Quality">All generated code includes comments explaining the logic, making it educational and maintainable for your team.</InfoItem>

## Real-World Examples

### Business Intelligence Queries
**Question**: "Show me monthly revenue trends by product category for the last year"

**Generated SQL**:
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
    product_category,
    SUM(revenue) as monthly_revenue,
    LAG(SUM(revenue)) OVER (
        PARTITION BY product_category 
        ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
    ) as previous_month_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY month, product_category
ORDER BY month DESC, monthly_revenue DESC;
```

### Statistical Analysis
**Question**: "Predict customer churn based on usage patterns"

**Generated Python**:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load and prepare data
df = pd.read_sql(sql_query, connection)
features = ['usage_frequency', 'session_duration', 'last_login_days']
X = df[features]
y = df['churned']

# Train model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Generate predictions and insights
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': features,
    'importance': model.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
```
