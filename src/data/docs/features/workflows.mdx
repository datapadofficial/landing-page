  - question: "Which data sources work best with workflows?"
    answer: "Workflows perform best with marketing data (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, analytics), sales data (CRM systems), and website analytics. The more comprehensive your connected data, the more accurate and actionable the generated strategies become."
  - question: "Can I customize workflows for my industry?"
    answer: "Yes! Workflows adapt to your business context, industry, and connected data sources. You can also provide additional context about your business goals, target audience, and brand guidelines to get more tailored results."
  - question: "How often should I run workflows?"
    answer: "This depends on your business needs and data update frequency. Most businesses run strategic workflows monthly or quarterly, while tactical workflows (like ad optimization) can be run weekly. The system will suggest optimal timing based on your data patterns."
