faqs:
  - question: "How complex can my natural language queries be?"
    answer: "You can ask very sophisticated questions involving multiple data sources, time comparisons, statistical analysis, and complex business logic. The system handles multi-step queries like 'Compare Q3 revenue by product line to last year, excluding discontinued items, and show statistical significance.'"
  - question: "What if the system doesn't understand my question?"
    answer: "The AI will ask clarifying questions to better understand your intent. You can rephrase using different business terms, break complex questions into smaller parts, or use the suggested question prompts that appear based on your data structure."
  - question: "Can I use industry-specific terminology?"
    answer: "Absolutely! The system learns and adapts to your business vocabulary and industry terminology. The more you use specific terms for your metrics, products, or processes, the better it becomes at understanding your unique business context."
  - question: "How does this compare to writing SQL queries myself?"
    answer: "Natural language queries are much faster for exploration and accessible to non-technical users, while custom SQL gives you precise control. Many users start with natural language to explore and understand data, then move to custom SQL for production reports and complex analysis."

## Plain English Data Access

Natural Language Queries eliminate the technical barriers between you and your data. Ask sophisticated analytical questions using the same business terminology you use every day, and get precise results without needing to learn SQL, understand database schemas, or navigate complex interfaces.

## Query Capabilities

### Simple Aggregations
Ask straightforward questions about your data:

- **"What was our revenue last month?"**
- **"How many new customers did we acquire this quarter?"**
- **"Which product had the highest sales yesterday?"**
- **"What's our average order value this year?"**

### Complex Comparisons
Perform sophisticated comparative analysis:

- **"Compare Q3 performance to the same period last year"**
- **"Show revenue by region for mobile vs desktop users"**
- **"How do conversion rates differ between marketing channels?"**
- **"Which customer segments have the highest lifetime value?"**

### Time-Based Analysis
Explore trends and patterns over time:

- **"Show me monthly growth trends for the past year"**
- **"What's our week-over-week change in user engagement?"**
- **"How does seasonal performance compare to previous years?"**
- **"When do we typically see our highest sales volumes?"**


## Advanced Natural Language Features

### Context Awareness
The system maintains context throughout your session:

- **Build complex analyses** through iterative questions
- **Remember definitions** you've established in conversation
- **Understand pronouns** and references to earlier results

You can add context on Workspace, Source or User level.

### Fuzzy Matching
Flexible interpretation handles real-world language:

- **Spelling variations** and typos in metric names
- **Synonym recognition** for business terms
- **Partial matches** when you're not sure of exact names
- **Contextual disambiguation** when terms could mean multiple things

### Multi-Source Queries
Ask questions that span multiple data sources:

- **"Combine CRM data with website analytics"**
- **"Show social media performance alongside sales data"**
- **"Compare advertising spend to revenue generation"**
