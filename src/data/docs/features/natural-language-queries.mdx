faqs:
  - question: "How complex can my natural language queries be?"
    answer: "You can ask very sophisticated questions involving multiple data sources, time comparisons, statistical analysis, and complex business logic. The system handles multi-step queries like 'Compare Q3 revenue by product line to last year, excluding discontinued items, and show statistical significance.'"
  - question: "What if the system doesn't understand my question?"
    answer: "The AI will ask clarifying questions to better understand your intent. You can rephrase using different business terms, break complex questions into smaller parts, or use the suggested question prompts that appear based on your data structure."
  - question: "Can I use industry-specific terminology?"
    answer: "Absolutely! The system learns and adapts to your business vocabulary and industry terminology. The more you use specific terms for your metrics, products, or processes, the better it becomes at understanding your unique business context."
  - question: "How does this compare to writing SQL queries myself?"
    answer: "Natural language queries are much faster for exploration and accessible to non-technical users, while custom SQL gives you precise control. Many users start with natural language to explore and understand data, then move to custom SQL for production reports and complex analysis."
