faqs:
  - question: "How does the system decide which AI model to use?"
    answer: "The routing system analyzes your question's complexity, data types, expected output format, and historical performance patterns. For example, statistical analysis goes to Claude, creative content to GPT, and specialized tasks to domain-specific models. The process is automatic and transparent."
  - question: "Can I manually choose which AI model to use?"
    answer: "Yes! While automatic routing is recommended for optimal results, advanced users can override the system and specify which model to use for specific queries. This is useful for testing different approaches or when you have specific model preferences."
  - question: "How do you ensure consistent quality across different models?"
    answer: "We continuously monitor response quality, track success rates, and collect user feedback for each model-task combination. The routing algorithm learns from this data and automatically improves model selection over time to maintain consistently high-quality results."
  - question: "What happens when new AI models become available?"
    answer: "New models are integrated automatically into the routing system after thorough testing and validation. The system evaluates their performance against existing models and gradually incorporates them into the routing decisions, ensuring you always have access to the latest AI capabilities."
