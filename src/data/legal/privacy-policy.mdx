## What Information We Collect

### Information you provide to us

You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and email address, when you register with us. If you correspond with us by email, by phone or via the website, we may retain the content of your messages, your email address or phone number and our responses.

### Registration on our website

Individuals accessing our web applications are asked to register (sign up for a free/paid account) via our website. When you register, you will be asked to provide some limited personal data: your name, company affiliation and company email address. Also required is a unique password to access your account. (Please do not share your password with anyone.)

You can also register and create an account through Google. Personal data you have provided to Google will be made available to us to set up your account. When you sign up for an account with us through Google, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

We do not collect "sensitive" or "special" categories of personal data.

### Information you provide automatically

When you access the website, we automatically collect certain personal and other information regarding, for example, the device you are using and how you interact with the website and web applications. Collected information may specifically include:

1. The browser types and versions used
2. The operating system used by your device
3. The website from which access our website (so-called referrers)
4. The sub-websites
5. The date and time (so-called timestamp) of access to the Internet site
6. The Internet protocol address (IP address) associated with your device

We will store this information in server log files. We also automatically collect information about your use of the website and web applications, such as web requests, number of clicks, domain names, pages viewed and the amount of time spent on particular pages.

This information is needed to:

1. Deliver the content of our website and web applications correctly
2. Optimize the content of our website and web applications
3. Ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology
4. Provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack

In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our website or web applications. To help us serve your needs better, we use “cookies” to store and sometimes track user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device’s hard drive. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your browser. You may also be able to delete or opt out of cookies. Please see our Cookies Policy for more information.

In addition, log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our website or web applications, our servers automatically record certain information that your browser sends whenever you visit any website.

Datapad also analyzes anonymously collected data and statistics to improve your experience and to ensure and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by users.

### Online Newsletter

The Datapad newsletter, which is distributed via email, contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such emails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, Datapad may see if and when an email was opened by the recipient and which links in the email were called up (clicked on).

### Company Information

You may provide other information about you and your company, such as your role, industry, company size, annual revenue, etc. Such information is securely stored and might be used for benchmarking and other targeting purposes. Datapad may collect such information with the help of third-party sub-processors, to ensure a better experience and profiling. You may update or correct such information, at any time, by logging in to your account.

This personal data will not be passed on to third parties.

### Benchmarks

Datapad may use your data to calculate and provide benchmarking services. The data collected for participation in the benchmarks ecosystem shall, at any time, be anonymized and removed from any personal or sensitive information.

In addition, to ensure anonymity, benchmarks shall be calculated and available only, if Datapad has at least 10 different sources of data within the selected cohort.

In providing its services to its clients, Datapad may be considered a "service provider" for purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").

## Located in the United States

Datapad and our website and web applications are located and hosted in the United States and governed by US law. If you are outside the United States when you visit the website, web application or engage in communications with us via mail, e-mail or telephone, please be aware that your personal data may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located. Any information you provide to us, or that we collect through your use of the websites or web applications will be stored, processed, and transferred within or to the United States. Please be aware that the United States and jurisdictions other than the one in which you are located may not provide the same level of data protection as considered adequate in your country. Note also that your personal data may be available to the US Government or its agencies under legal process in the United States.

## EEA and United Kingdom Privacy Rights

### The Legal Basis for Using EEA and UK Personal Data

For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), we advise that your personal data will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different from those in your country and may not be as protective. The United States has not sought or received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal data is to do so with your consent; where we need the personal data for performance of a contract or requested service, including to provide you with our Newsletter, or where the collection and use is in our or another’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the personal data in question. If we collected your personal data with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.

Our retention of your personal data and any subsequent communications are based on our legitimate interest in providing you with new and potentially relevant materials based on your geography, role, or company. As always, you can elect to opt out from receiving such future communications.

To the extent that we transfer Personal data from the EEA, to a jurisdiction outside the EEA that has not been adduced by the European Commission as providing adequate data protections (such as the United States), we will ensure that such personal data is safeguarded through appropriate contractual terms or other approved mechanisms.

### Rights for EEA and UK Residents

In addition, if you are a resident of the EEA or United Kingdom you have the right to:

- Find out if we use your personal data, to access your personal data, and receive copies of your personal data
- Withdraw any express consent that you have provided to the processing of your personal data at any time without penalty
- Access your personal data and have it corrected or amended if it is inaccurate or incomplete
- Obtain a transferable copy of some of your personal data which can be transferred to another provider when the personal data was processed based on your consent
- If you believe your personal data is inaccurate, no longer necessary for our business purposes, or if you object to our processing of your personal data, you also have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your data pending our investigation and/or verification of your claim
- Request your personal data be deleted or restricted under certain circumstances. For example, if using your personal data on the basis of your consent and has no other legal basis to use such, you may request your personal data be deleted when you withdraw your consent

Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If we ask you to provide personal data to us to comply with a legal requirement or enter into a contract, we will inform you of this and let you know whether providing us with your personal data is required and if not, the consequences of not sharing your personal data with us.

Similarly, if we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our or a third party’s legitimate interests and those interests are not already described above, we will let you know what those legitimate interests are.

We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

To withdraw consent or exercise these rights, please contact us via email at [hello@datapad.io](mailto:hello@datapad.io).

If you are not satisfied with our response, or believe we are processing your personal data in violation of the law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Supervisory Authority (also known as Data Protection Authority) or other appropriate governmental authority in your EEA Member State. You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

## Security

Personal data we collect is securely stored within our database on our own servers or databases hosted by cloud provider in secured environments. We use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers – 256 bit) for protecting your information.

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Datapad and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Datapad makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Please do not provide your account password to another person. We cannot be responsible for a data breach or other incident if a password is used by unauthorized persons.

We will keep your personal data in active files or systems as long as needed to meet the purposes for which it was collected, to provide the services or products you requested, or as otherwise may be required by law.

## Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Datapad and its products and services are intended for adults 18 years or older. Since our content and services are not directed towards kids, children under 16 are not allowed to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our website. If you are under 16, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 16 is allowed to provide any personal data to or on Datapad. If we discover that we have collected personal data from a child under the age of 16 without parental consent, Datapad will delete that information as soon as possible.

## User Content and Message Confidentiality

Your user content is kept private in your network. Datapad does not monitor the user content you post on the website. We do not have administrative tools to view our users’ messages, and access to the database is only granted to our technicians on a case-by-case basis to troubleshoot specific technical issues, or as may be required by law.

## My Choices and Rights

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or in the Terms of Service, as applicable, we will only use personal data for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You must "opt in" and give us permission to use your personal data for any other purpose. You may always change your preference and "opt out" of receiving certain marketing communications from us by contacting us via email at [hello@datapad.io](mailto:hello@datapad.io).

## Our Legal Obligation to Disclose Your Information

We will reveal a user’s personal data without his/her prior permission only when we have reason to believe that the disclosure of this information is required to establish the identity of, to contact or to initiate legal proceedings against a person or persons who are suspected of infringing rights or property belonging to Datapad or to others who could be harmed by the user’s activities or of persons who could (deliberately or otherwise) transgress upon these rights and property. We also may disclose personal data when we have good reason to believe that this is legally required.

## Can I update or correct my information?

You can ask to review and correct the information about you that Datapad keeps on file by contacting us. Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to:

1. Update or correct your personally identifiable information
2. Change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us
3. Delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account

Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.

You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your Profile Settings or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal data stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.

You may, of course, decline to submit your personal data through Datapad, in which case Datapad may not be able to provide certain services to you.

## Compromise of Personal Data

In the event that personal data is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Datapad will promptly notify those persons whose personal data has been compromised, in accordance with the Notification Procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal data in public areas, on public bulletin boards or within the website, that information might be collected and disseminated by third parties, and result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from third-parties. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and this third-party conduct is out of the control of Datapad.

Please also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal data in your account, all users who are authorized to access such areas (users in your account) will have access to such personal data, and that information might be collected and disseminated by those users, and may result in, among other things, unsolicited inquiries, messages, and offers from such users. Datapad urges you to exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal data on the web application or website.

## Links to Other Websites

The website or web applications may also contain links to other websites owned or controlled by third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites. Before accessing any website, it is suggested you review the applicable privacy and other policies.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our website and notify users according to our Notifications Regarding This Privacy Policy to keep you aware of updates and changes as to what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective as of the date indicated above.

However, we will not make changes that result in significant additional uses or disclosures of your personal data without notifying you of such changes via email at least 14 days before such changes would apply.

If any non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy are unacceptable to you, you must immediately contact us and, until the issue is resolved, stop using the Datapad website and any services we provide. Your continued use of our services and the Datapad website and web application following the posting of non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes.
