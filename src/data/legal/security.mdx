Our platform is trusted by leading organizations including Princeton University, Spellbook, BCG, and Rice Business.

## How we protect your information

### We never use your data to train AI

Your data stays private. No information is shared between customers. Everything remains isolated, keeping your business information confidential.

### Data is encrypted in-transit and at-rest

Your information is encrypted when it's moving between systems and even when it's just sitting on our servers. This stops anyone from accessing or altering it without permission.

### Ephemeral processing, durable security

We securely delete your processed data as soon as it's not needed. Short-term storage reduces risks and helps keep you compliant with data regulations. Your uploaded files are encrypted and retained so you can revisit or build on them later.

### Roles based access control (RBAC)

Access is tightly controlled. Only the right people get access, reducing internal risks and ensuring accountability.
